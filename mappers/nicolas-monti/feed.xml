&lt;li>01: button that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing I&amp;rsquo;m expecting from Monti. Wacky shit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>02: dayum, this music track, lounge music? wild choice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of the textures being used, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen them used this way but they feel consistent with each other. I think this is one of Monti&amp;rsquo;s signature moves. It makes his work (so far) feel different yet consistent and not ugly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>no rocket launchers so far (unless they&amp;rsquo;re hidden), makes me sad. But maybe when I get it eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll be great, delayed gratification in Doom lol&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>random thoughts: Doom custom maps 30 years in, it&amp;rsquo;s inherently meta, it&amp;rsquo;s its own thing and universe, the mappers through their maps are speaking to each other, speaking to the maps in the original games&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
