&lt;li>collab between pcorf and Aro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of &amp;ldquo;causing&amp;rdquo; it. Now here&amp;rsquo;s a Doom map that&amp;rsquo;s explicitly about going into a &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; and blasting through hordes of &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo;. The music hits here, it&amp;rsquo;s melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>very tight ammo setup (tightest I&amp;rsquo;ve played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of time spent with the shotgun, smashing your head against bullet sponges. Enemy composition choices are questionable at times, it seems like the mappers were more interested in creating a hopeless vibe instead of purely &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; gameplay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maps get super long past the 1/2 mark&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map25: sneaky cyberdemon teleporting around ominously, very cool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ubiquitous crosses, inverted, normal, orthodox, but just generally there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of indented decoration in walls. It&amp;rsquo;s used a little too much maybe but it does provide the dozen maps of the wad with a unique look/feel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map26: organ music at start, great vibes for the evil cathedral setting of the map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>too long, overstays its welcome because the combat isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; enough to hold the rest of it up?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this has some really iconic set pieces / scenes (map30: hell-levator) but they&amp;rsquo;re spread a little because the maps are so long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ammo counts a little sus, even when making full use of chainsaw / berserk punching, you just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough. Although I can get a little better at punching demons&lt;/li>
