&lt;li>inspired by Going Down (mouldy)? The first track is by him and the concept seems related. AshtralFiend&amp;rsquo;s participation in this collab would make sense if that&amp;rsquo;s the case because mouldy&amp;rsquo;s work seems related to his generally.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Going Up?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tiny maps (1024x1024)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>these tiny maps really fit with most of what AshtralFiend has worked on so far, they seem fascinated by tiny tight maps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr07: tight wave-based arena fight, feels pretty good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of doomcute&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr15: using single skull next to doors to show that following this path will give you the appropriate skull/key, something to do myself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr22: AshtralFiend feels like a main character in this community project, his maps stand out. This one is kind of wild, finally walking around the tower and being able to fall all the way down.&lt;/li>
