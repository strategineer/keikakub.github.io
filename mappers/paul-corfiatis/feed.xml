&lt;li>collab between pcorf and Aro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of &amp;ldquo;causing&amp;rdquo; it. Now here&amp;rsquo;s a Doom map that&amp;rsquo;s explicitly about going into a &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; and blasting through hordes of &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo;. The music hits here, it&amp;rsquo;s melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>very tight ammo setup (tightest I&amp;rsquo;ve played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of time spent with the shotgun, smashing your head against bullet sponges. Enemy composition choices are questionable at times, it seems like the mappers were more interested in creating a hopeless vibe instead of purely &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; gameplay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maps get super long past the 1/2 mark&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map25: sneaky cyberdemon teleporting around ominously, very cool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ubiquitous crosses, inverted, normal, orthodox, but just generally there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of indented decoration in walls. It&amp;rsquo;s used a little too much maybe but it does provide the dozen maps of the wad with a unique look/feel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map26: organ music at start, great vibes for the evil cathedral setting of the map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>too long, overstays its welcome because the combat isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; enough to hold the rest of it up?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this has some really iconic set pieces / scenes (map30: hell-levator) but they&amp;rsquo;re spread a little because the maps are so long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ammo counts a little sus, even when making full use of chainsaw / berserk punching, you just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough. Although I can get a little better at punching demons&lt;/li>

 &lt;p>After 12,000 linedefs of action, you have won this battle and have destroyed the source of this demonic civilization. Condemnation is no more and the mystery of this pandemic has finally been solved. As you hop onto the derelict imperial space station Ondor (sic) for the long journey back home you destroy the rest of these beasts with ease blasting them to oblivion.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>400 line defs each megawad by one mapper (pcorf)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mostly consistent map length feels good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>economy of design, reusing the same spaces over and over again. A little bit of difficulty in differentiating the levels. There&amp;rsquo;s an intentional use of different textures-sets throughout but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to really make these maps feel really different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gradual expansion of arenas and combination of them as more monster closets are revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip; I like this more than I would have expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of random TPs used to move enemies around the arenas&amp;hellip; interesting but hard to parse. Makes the maps feel a little random. It feels like a bandaid to solve the problem of wanting to have these maps be tiny but re-use the existing spaces a bunch&amp;hellip; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map11: great example of this idea of opening an arena gradually&lt;/li>
&lt;li>timed buttons keep the pace up but sometimes slow you down when you miss the timing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>singular/low rocket ammo drops, forces tactical rocket use more than usual&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maps separated into mostly thematic episodes with different map design ethos/pillars in each it feels like&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2020 pandemic-inspired story line&lt;/li>
