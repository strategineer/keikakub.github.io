      <description>Virtual reality. You have to try it to believe it. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced and I think that everyone should get a chance to put a headset on. Modern VR headsets have been out in the wild for a little more than half a decade and yet&gt;&gt;</description>

      <description>Moving out of my childhood home to live on my own was tough. I realized this as I rolled out of the U-Haul truck with a piece of toast in one hand and my hopes and dreams in the other.

      <description>I've been thinking of buying a 3D printer…

It's something I've always been interested in but until recently I haven't had the space for it. The consumer 3D printing world has gotten a lot cheaper and simpler to get into in recent years.
