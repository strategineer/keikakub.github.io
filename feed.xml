Le Guin is subverting the old school military science-fiction trope of humans going around killing &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; with the humans doing the killing framed as the good guys who we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be rooting for. Maybe colonialism is bad?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taoism - The Parting Of The Way</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the book on Daoism that Ursula K. Le Guin recommends in &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09">her rendition of the Tao Te Ching&lt;/a> for anyone who reads the Tao Te Ching and wants to learn more about Daoism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K. Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s seal of approval, I&amp;rsquo;m expecting the rest of it to be just as good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Stone Sky</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Don Quixote</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-09/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-09/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Powers</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-08/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-08/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gifts</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-07/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Watkins Book Of English Folktales</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-04/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Complete Grimm's Fairy Tales</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-29/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-29/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hero With A Thousand Faces</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-20/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Unreal And The Real - The Selected Short Stories Of Ursula K.

Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s conclusion to her fantastic Earthsea series. Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve everything.

To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc. He&amp;rsquo;s great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Murder On The Orient Express - A Hercule Piorot Mystery</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>Murder on the Orient Express is similar to Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s Death on the Nile (the other Agatha Christie novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both novels involve Hercule Poirot on vacation traveling (on a train or on a boat respectively), with the soon-to-be murder victim asking Poirot for help, him declining and then after the murder occurs, Poirot proceeds to solve the murder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Death on the Nile was SO MUCH MORE of a compelling read for me. Murder on the Orient Express is&amp;hellip; Uhhhhh&amp;hellip; Express, it&amp;rsquo;s fast and straightforward. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time. As soon as possible you&amp;rsquo;re jumping straight into the murder followed by a by-the-numbers solving of the mystery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terry Pratchett: A Life With Footnotes - The Official Biography</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-28/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-28/</guid><description>&lt;p>Terry Pratchett is an all-timer.

&lt;p>Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s got one of the most unsettling POVs I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while. It starts weird and only gets weirder from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great Halloween read.

&lt;p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, far from it.

Each time I sat down to read, it only took a few sentences to transport me completely into this world that V.E. Schwab has so carefully built.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Gathering of Shadows develops the characters introduced in the previous book (along with some fresh faces), portrays the evolution of their relationships with one another and sets everything up for what I&amp;rsquo;m confident is going to be a riveting conclusion to the trilogy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terminal Alliance</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-17/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-17/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book is a joke and not a very funny one.

&lt;p>The tonal clash between the comedic intent of the author and the violent story centered around a group of janitors trying to stop a genocide is jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters are nothing more than caricatures and this is a trainwreck waiting to happen given the inclusion of a comic relief autistic character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shards Of Earth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-16/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>A great space opera by the king of writing alien aliens. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic romp where we follow free adventures of a ragtag group of scoundrels doing their best to save the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could have been just &amp;ldquo;another one of those&amp;rdquo; is greatly elevated by the Adrian Tchaikovsky touch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Light Brigade</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-09/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-09/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout.

&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After reading through Death on the Nile for the first time, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend that we add the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Camp&amp;rdquo; to that list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Death on the Nile is one of the funniest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.

But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There&amp;rsquo;s ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in.
