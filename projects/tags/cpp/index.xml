      <description>Developed an Unreal Engine 4 Plugin (C++) for importing and iterating on art assets from Shotgun and Perforce into Unreal Engine projects with one click. Developed a data-driven system for automating the generation of new projects in Perforce and Jenkins based on a project-specific specification of Perforce hierarchies of depots, streams and source branching strategies. Developed a Python command line tool which acted as the glue connecting Perforce, Shotgun and Unreal Engine which was used primarily for detecting changed art assets, generating turntables automatically and uploading them to Shotgun for stakeholders to review if needed.</description>

      <description>Get Out was developed using Unreal Engine 4 for my team&amp;rsquo;s final project in the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).
We were a team of six programmers including Thomas Dobranowski (AI), Christian Nioré, Alexis Plet (Gameplay), Charles Santourian (UI), Frank Kongue Wankam (AI) and myself.
I pitched the initial idea which was based a video game prototype I had designed, playtested and built in the summer of 2015.</description>

      <title>Great Turtle Adventure IV</title>

      <description>Great Turtle Adventure IV was developed using a custom game engine I designed and built (with DirectX 10 and PhysX) inspired by the game engine built by Gaspard Petit and the DirectX 10 knowledge provided by François Jean during my first semester in the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).
The project was completed mostly by myself with the help of Mathieu Langlois and Dominique Lacombe who helped me close the project in the last couple of days before the deadline.</description>

      <description>Battleships was developed using C++ and SDL in a team of three programmers composed of Benjamin Lewis, Franz-Philippe Garcia and myself in my second year at McGill University within the context of the Software Engineering course led by Jörg Kienzle.
I worked specifically on the game client, the graphics code and the art.</description>
