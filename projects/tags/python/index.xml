      <title>Lynchman</title>

      <description>Lynchman was developed with python. It can be used to compute data based on Beat Saber (a Virtual Reality rhythm game where you&amp;rsquo;re tasked with using your arms to slice fast moving blocks in time with music) maps and using that data to generate maps automatically (using Markov Chains) for given song files.
NB: The name of the project is based on the character Lynchman from one of the best animated movies of all time, Redline.</description>

      <description>Developed an Unreal Engine 4 Plugin (C++) for importing and iterating on art assets from Shotgun and Perforce into Unreal Engine projects with one click. Developed a data-driven system for automating the generation of new projects in Perforce and Jenkins based on a project-specific specification of Perforce hierarchies of depots, streams and source branching strategies. Developed a Python command line tool which acted as the glue connecting Perforce, Shotgun and Unreal Engine which was used primarily for detecting changed art assets, generating turntables automatically and uploading them to Shotgun for stakeholders to review if needed.</description>

      <description>Artifact Stat Tracker was developed using python and Google Sheets.
As I played the game, I entered data into the Google Sheets document using custom built UIs, the python script would then read the data within the Google Sheets document, manipulate it and inject it, with more contextual information, back into the Google Sheets document.
The Google Sheets document would then use the given data produce tables and charts with interesting insights to help improve my play on a competitive level such as:</description>

      <description>Machine Head was developed using python and an instance of it is constantly running on a Raspberry Pi at my house. It was built for automating various manual processes tied to managing my Discord server that I was tired of doing over and over again.
I dove into Linux head first to optimize my programming workflow which, on this project, consisted of working in my development environment (a Windows PC using the Linux Subsystem for Windows with Ubuntu), testing the changes in this environment on a sandbox server on Discord, pushing the changes into the production environment (my Raspberry Pi).</description>

      <description>I worked at Borealys Games, an independent video game studio, from May 2016 until November 2017. I mostly worked on Mages of Mystralia but I also worked on other unannounced/cancelled projects.
We were two/three programmers working on Mages of Mystralia (Anthony Demange as lead programmer and Vincent Bilodeau as graphics programmer).
On Mages of Mystralia, I touched almost everything given the small size of the team but I focused specifically on these parts of the game:</description>

      <description>A wise computer once told me, &amp;ldquo;Peremptory personal, Perpendiculars, Forestry spreadsheets zaniest.&amp;rdquo;
If you enjoy writing and/or programming then you should give Writerator a shot!
Oh&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;re still here. OK.
Well, Writerator gives the curious user access to many tools to find specific information about their texts such as the number of times &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; appears or the words in a text sorted by how many times &amp;ldquo;e&amp;rdquo; appears in them.</description>

      <description>InfiniCube is the first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; video game that I developed. I made it during the winter break of my first semester of the Honours Software Engineering program at McGill University.
It features two campaigns with themed levels based on bad puns and an infinite mode with levels being created in a human readable data format.</description>
