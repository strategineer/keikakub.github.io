Developed a data-driven system for automating the generation of new projects in Perforce and Jenkins based on a project-specific specification of Perforce hierarchies of depots, streams and source branching strategies. Developed a Python command line tool which acted as the glue connecting Perforce, Shotgun and Unreal Engine which was used primarily for detecting changed art assets, generating turntables automatically and uploading them to Shotgun for stakeholders to review if needed.</description></item><item><title>Get Out</title><link>https://strategineer.com/projects/2016-05-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/projects/2016-05-10/</guid><description>Get Out was developed using Unreal Engine 4 for my team&amp;rsquo;s final project in the DDJV program at the University of Sherbrooke (Campus Longueuil).
We were a team of six programmers including Thomas Dobranowski (AI), Christian Nior√©, Alexis Plet (Gameplay), Charles Santourian (UI), Frank Kongue Wankam (AI) and myself.
I pitched the initial idea which was based a video game prototype I had designed, playtested and built in the summer of 2015.</description></item></channel></rss>
