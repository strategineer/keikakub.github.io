After reading it, you'll be able to see it echoed everywhere you look.</p><hr><p>I&rsquo;ve never read the Odyssey, and so I chose to read a recent translation of it by Emily Wilson.</p><p>It&rsquo;s written in modern English making it easy to read. There&rsquo;s no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It&rsquo;s a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.</p><p>Odysseus is a mass murderer and a villain… yet in the story he’s presented as a victim and a hero. It’s… complex.</p><p>I can understand why some people have spent their entire lives studying this story and Greek mythology in general (especially after also reading Robert Grave’s The Greek Myths).</p><p>Zeus rapes a lot and there’s a lot of murder, but if you can stomach it, Greek Mythology is a wild ride.</p><p>These stories keep being retold again and again in different forms and understanding where all these tropes come from is fun.</p><p>Sonic is Hermes.</p><p>One Piece is a retelling of Jason’s, and the Argonauts’s, quest for the Golden Fleece.</p><p>Odysseus is a superhero, with powers coming from Athena’s favor, straight out of a comic book (or Marvel movie). Normal humans can’t murder a hundred people with a bow in a dining hall, make anyone believe anything and wear some rags to perfectly disguise their identity.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s in part what makes the story interesting.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-15/>◀️Meditations: A New Translation</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-16/>▶️Heart: The City Beneath</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-22/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Games: Agency as Art</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-19/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>On Being Awesome: A Unified Theory of How Not to Suck</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-01/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Media Literacy</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 19 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
