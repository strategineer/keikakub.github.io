9781639731701</div><div class="row justify-content-center readable"><p>Eight translators travel to Poland to translate Irena Rey&rsquo;s next novel. Hijinks ensue.</p><p>The Extinction of Irena Rey is a novel about translation, transmission, authorship, author worship, media literacy, Mycelium, <em>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</em>, Poland, climate change, weebs and everything but the kitchen sink.</p><p>I&rsquo;m amazed by how much spaghetti Jennifer Croft is throwing at the wall in this novel and how much of it sticks. Even when it doesn&rsquo;t work, when the prose is a little too purple, it kind of still works just in a different way because of the framing of the story.</p><p>The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is a frame story (<a href=/books/9780575069015/>I can&rsquo;t get enough of them</a>) in which a woman named Alexis Archer has translated a text (peppering it with extensive footnotes) written by, in their mother tongue, and told from the perspective of one of her fellow translators.</p><p>This text, also named The Extinction of Irena Rey, is a personal account of the events that transpired between the author, Alexis Archer, and Irena Rey&rsquo;s six other translators, most of whom have known each other for over a decade, who&rsquo;ve travelled to Poland to translate Irena Rey&rsquo;s latest work.</p><p>Of course, hijinks ensue.</p><p>Jennifer Croft plays with this framing in interesting ways and that&rsquo;s what makes this novel special. I enjoyed slowly nibbling away at it while trying to integrate all the disparate ideas in the text into a cohesive whole. Getting to know the translators and how they fit into the bigger picture was enjoyable even though some of them really suck.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t tend to like mystery novels much. The Extinction of Irena Rey is the first mystery novel I&rsquo;ve enjoyed without any caveats. The mystery that begins to reveal itself as you read the text is not constantly thrown in your face which I appreciated.</p><p>Instead, the mystery is the kettle on the stove all these translators are swimming in and butting heads in. The mystery isn&rsquo;t being used as a carrot on a stick to keep the reader artificially engaged with the story <a href=/books/9781473223851/>like in some novels</a>.</p><p>The mystery is the story and the story is the mystery and everything surrounding it fits nicely together and enhances the rest of the story in a meaningful way.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for a mystery-related beat halfway through the novel:</strong></p><span class=spoiler><p>Around midway through the novel, after the initial setup and reveal of the core mystery, one of the translators, Freddie starts an uncharacteristic Detective Poirot-esque monologue where he lists out all the information and clues that the translators have gathered so far and he mentions possible further avenues for their investigation to take.</p><p>Considering the tone of the speech and Freddie being the one giving it, I interpret this as a shot being taken by Jennifer Croft at that style of mystery novel and signaling to the reader that she&rsquo;s trying to do something different.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The Agathie Christie-esque mystery novel is still very popular and it&rsquo;s been copied more times than we can count, seemingly by many authors who don&rsquo;t seem to understand how to bring that genre forth into the modern day in a compelling way.</p><p>And, I think that Croft really is doing something different with the mystery in the Extinction of Irena Rey that hits way harder for me than other mystery novels I&rsquo;ve read.</p></span><p>This novel is begging to be thought about during and after reading it and I love that about it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not perfect though, I would have preferred a few less paragraphs where Croft uses her characters to speak directly to the reader about her thoughts on the process of translation.</p><p>These felt a little redundant and sometimes out of place especially because I seem to have a similar understanding about the art of translation as Croft does.</p><p>A great translation must by necessity transform the text it&rsquo;s based on to be great and this requires the translator to be just as much of a writer as the original author, if not more.</p><p>One cannot ignore translators like Margaret Jull Costa especially known for her work translating most of <a href=/authors/jos%C3%A9-saramago/>José Saramago&rsquo;s work into English</a> a Herculean task I wouldn&rsquo;t wish upon my greatest enemy, and still make reductive claims about a translator&rsquo;s work being lesser than a writer&rsquo;s work because, well, translators are writers.</p><p>What elevates The Extinction of Irena Rey to a 5/5 for me and allows me to fully enjoy it for what it is despite the minor quibbles I have with it &mdash; is how big of a swing it&rsquo;s taking, how absolutely weird it is and how Croft manages to stick the landing anyway. I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye Jennifer Croft&rsquo;s work moving forward &mdash; she&rsquo;s at least convinced me that I should be paying attention to her.</p><p>Now all I&rsquo;ve got to do now is figure out how I&rsquo;m going to deal with all this spaghetti Croft has thrown all around my reading nook.</p><p>Slurp Slurp.</p><p>Slurp Slurp.</p></div></article><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/9780593544792/>◀️You Dreamed of Empires</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/apocalypse_world_2e/>▶️Apocalypse World (2nd Edition)</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's homepage" class="menu-button btn btn-lg btn-dark">
