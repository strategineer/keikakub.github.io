Let&rsquo;s set the stage (you can read all of this on the front cover so no spoilers):
In Space Opera, an intergalactic World War 2-standin breaks out, causing much destruction and suffering (while humans remain woefully unaware of this).
As a result of this confrontation, the remaining alien civilizations unite and organize a Eurovision-esque contest (the Metagalactic Grand Prix) to determine how the resources of the galaxy will be shared amongst the participants for the following year (based on their relative ranking in contest)...." property="og:description"><meta content="https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-07/" property="og:url"><meta content="/books/2023-06-07/thumbnail_huc2601fa88bdc5f98424b737fc138ee58_170939_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp" property="og:image"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta content="#43B581" data-react-helmet=true name=theme-color><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/bootstrap.min.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href="/apple-touch-icon.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href="/favicon-32x32.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href="/favicon-16x16.png?v=1"><link rel=manifest href="/site.webmanifest?v=1"><link rel=mask-icon href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=1" color=#5bbad5><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?v=1"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#da532c"><meta name=theme-color content="#ff0000"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/site.min.css><title>Strat's Books</title></head><body id=documentTop><div class=container-fluid><div class="row no-margin justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-12 main no-margin"><nav class=footer-index><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-9 col-12"><div class="container author-blurb"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/><img class="rounded avatar-static float-left" src=/img/fe_portrait.png alt="Strat's Avatar"></a></div><div class="col-md-6 col-auto align-self-center"><div class=row><div class="col-auto text-center">Name's Strat; I read a lot of books, here's my digital bookshelf sorted by genre.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></nav><div class=readable><div class=books-content><div class="container justify-content-center text-center page-title"><div class=row><h1>Space Opera</h1></div></div><div class="col-auto text-center"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/authors/catherynne-m.-valente/>Catherynne M.

I actually laughed out loud quite a few times and that&rsquo;s something i cherish because writing comedic novels is anything but easy.</p><p>The novel has a unique voice that might rub some people the wrong way. The way that the many run-on sentences were written gave the text an almost lyrical vibe that felt like a good fit given the premise of the book.</p><p>I would have given Space Opera a 5/5 but unfortunately I feel as though the book would have benefited greatly from more of a focus on the main character Danesh and his partner in crime Oort. Spending more time with them, experiencing their newly expanded world (filled with many alien aliens) from their perspective would have been great. Instead, many chapters are spent describing in detail the events/winners of past Metagalactic Grand Prix(s).</p><p>These chapters are fine in isolation but, within the context of the rest of the novel, they clash with the more personal chapters preceding and following them leading to a less fulfilling read (at least for me).</p><p>Overall, I recommend Space Opera if you&rsquo;re looking for something light, that might make you smile and chuckle more than you would expect.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-12/>◀️A Darker Shade of Magic</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/>▶️Children of Ruin</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Stone Sky</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Left Hand of Darkness</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-14/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>We</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-11/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>A Desolation Called Peace</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching: A Book about the Way and the Power of the Way</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 133 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/authors/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
