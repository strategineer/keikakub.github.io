<strong>It was a relief to have my clients headed back to safety. But it felt odd to be back on my own again, working for no one except myself.</strong></li><li>The two main characters in this novella are a human robot hybrid and a sentient transport ship who spend a lot of time &ldquo;Netflix and Chilling&rdquo; with each other in cyberspace.
<strong>I pinged the transport again and gave it the same offer I had given the first transport: hundreds of hours of media, serials, books, music, including some new shows I had just picked up on the way through the transit mall, in exchange for a ride.</strong></li><li>Murderbot spends most of its time in this novella either &ldquo;Netflix and Chilling&rdquo; with ART or hacking cyberspace security systems to prevent its incompetent clients from being murdered.</li><li>Murderbot is working as a freelancer and is forced into participating in the gig economy to stay afloat. If it gets hurt on the job, well too bad, it&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to deal with its injuries on its own.</li></ul><p>This is very cyberpunky and I like it.</p><p>Overall, I enjoyed the novella but the high level of plot-driving stupidity on display from Murderbot&rsquo;s clients this time around prevented me from being as invested in the narrative, compared to All Systems Red.</p><p>I really enjoyed the interactions between Murderbot and ART though. I&rsquo;m really invested in Murderbot&rsquo;s journey and seeing where it goes from here.</p><p>PS: There&rsquo;s a lot of horrific ideas I&rsquo;ve been introduced to in the Murderbot Diaries series so far but one of them rises above and beyond all of the others in terms of how wild it is.</p><p>It blows my mind that there are people in this universe who, for whatever reason (hopefully there&rsquo;s satisfying answers/context for this later down the line), choose to have committed relationships with 8+ other people who also happen to be their coworkers.</p><p>Being in a relationship with 8 other people? I can see that.</p><p>Being in a relationship with 1 coworker? That&rsquo;s probably fine.</p><p>Imagine being married to not ONE but ALL of your coworkers&mldr; Really think about that.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-14/>◀️Rogue Protocol</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/>▶️Thud!</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Death with Interruptions</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-03/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-29/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Child Thief</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-19/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Sword & Citadel: The Second Half of The Book of the New Sun</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Shadow & Claw: The First Half of The Book of the New Sun</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 111 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/books/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
