It&rsquo;s not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it&rsquo;s not them; it&rsquo;s me. I know I&rsquo;m a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes us both nervous, which makes me even more nervous.</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m not a horrifying murderbot. I am autistic though and if you replace &ldquo;horrifying murderbot&rdquo; with &ldquo;autist&rdquo; in the quote above, that&rsquo;s a pretty accurate description of what it feels like at times.</p><p>Murderbot&rsquo;s struggle with social anxiety throughout the novella was depicted very well and it really resonated with me.</p><p>Secondly, in a sense, we&rsquo;re all Murderbot.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-07/>◀️Priestdaddy</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-05/>▶️I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Stone Sky</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Left Hand of Darkness</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-14/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>We</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-11/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>A Desolation Called Peace</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching: A Book about the Way and the Power of the Way</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 133 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/authors/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
