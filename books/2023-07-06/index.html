It&rsquo;s not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it&rsquo;s not them; it&rsquo;s me. I know I&rsquo;m a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes us both nervous, which makes me even more nervous.</strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m not a horrifying murderbot. I am autistic though and if you replace &ldquo;horrifying murderbot&rdquo; with &ldquo;autist&rdquo; in the quote above, that&rsquo;s a pretty accurate description of what it feels like at times.</p><p>Murderbot&rsquo;s struggle with social anxiety throughout the novella was depicted very well and it really resonated with me.</p><p>Secondly, in a sense, we&rsquo;re all Murderbot.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/>◀️Thud!</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-05/>▶️I'm Thinking of Ending Things</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-29/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Murder on the Orient Express</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-25/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Secret of the Golden Flower: A Chinese Book of Life</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-18/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Ultimate Micro-RPG Book: 40 Fast, Easy, and Fun Tabletop Games</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-13/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Guards!
