This amounts to him basically saying "Just write a lot bro" but despite this, this was quite a fun read. And... He's not wrong.</p><hr><p>On Writing by Stephen King is half part autobiography and half part a guide to writing. You probably know Stephen King&rsquo;s work and you&rsquo;ve probably seen one of the thousands of movie adaptations of his books like It, Carrie or Shawshank Redemption). He is extremely prolific and he&rsquo;s one of my favorite writers so when I heard that he wrote this book on writing, I picked it up right away.</p><p>On Writing does not disappoint. He tells the story of his life and his road to becoming the writer he is today. As you would expect, it&rsquo;s a real page turner. Stephen King could write about paint drying and you would be glued to your seat.</p><p>Eventually, Stephen starts to give advice to people who want to become better writers. He mostly just says to write what you know and to practice every day? To be fair, I&rsquo;ve become a better writer since I started following his advice soooooooooooo he must be onto something.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one passage in particular that has been stuck in my brain for a while now and here it is.</p><p>He says that &ldquo;Writing is telephathy.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Look- here&rsquo;s a table covered with red cloth. On it is a cage the size of a small fish aquarium. In the cage is a white rabbit with a pink nose and pink-rimmed eyes. […] On its back, clearly marked in blue ink, is the numeral 8. […] The most interesting thing here isn&rsquo;t even the carrot-munching rabbit in the cage, but the number on its back. Not a six, not a four, not nineteen-point-five. It&rsquo;s an eight. This is what we&rsquo;re looking at, and we all see it. I didn&rsquo;t tell you. You didn&rsquo;t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours. We&rsquo;re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room… except we are together. We are close. We&rsquo;re having a meeting of the minds. […] We&rsquo;ve engaged in an act of telepathy. No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s something very personal about writing and reading that makes it worth doing. It was nice to be reminded of that.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-15/>◀️The Joy of Mixology</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-17/>▶️Monster of the Week</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-18/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Aesthetic Life and Why It Matters (Thinking Art)</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-19/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>On Being Awesome: A Unified Theory of How Not to Suck</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-01/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Media Literacy</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 23 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
