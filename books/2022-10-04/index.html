It&rsquo;s not what I expected but it&rsquo;s interesting so far. I hope these kids got paid.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>So ya&mldr; Funnily enough, all the authors are adults, the large majority of which are middle grade and young adult fiction writers.</p><p>This explains why most of the (very) short stories are told from the perspective of children. But it doesn&rsquo;t explain why some of the stories feel like they were written by children.</p><p>The quality is all over the place. I&rsquo;m never read an anthology before but I don&rsquo;t think I like it. The lack of a single voice makes for bite-sized texts that don&rsquo;t have a lot of space to say anything interesting.</p><p>If given the choice, I would have preferred a bunch of stories like this from one author instead of this.</p><p>The stories that really gripped me, well, I wanted them to be longer (there&rsquo;s only so much you can do in just a few pages). And the truly awful stories, well, I ask myself how they made their way into the anthology in the first place.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-03/>▶️Aesthetic Life and Why It Matters (Thinking Art)</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-03/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Aesthetic Life and Why It Matters (Thinking Art)</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-17/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Performance Rock Climbing</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-16/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>9 out of 10 climbers make the same mistakes</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-15/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Self Coached Climber</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-14/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Games: Agency as Art</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 24 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/books/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
