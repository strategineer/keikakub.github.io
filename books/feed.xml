Hunt high school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully. It seems OK, nothing extraordinary or unique other than the conceit.</description></item><item><title>Heart: The City Beneath</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-16/</guid><description>Heart: The City Beneath is a tabletop roleplaying game about delving into a nightmare undercity that will give you everything you’ve ever dreamed of – or kill you in the process. It is a dungeon-crawling, story-forward tabletop RPG that focuses on what characters have to lose in pursuit of their dreams in the chaotic darkness beneath the world. Weird but in a good way.</description></item><item><title>The Mindbody Prescription</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-01/</guid><description>As someone who&amp;rsquo;s been suffering with chronic pain issues for years now, I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for anything I can do to help myself feel less pain. Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there seems to be a grain of truth (for me, at least). It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know) suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.</description></item><item><title>Think</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-15/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-15/</guid><description>Think is a book about the big questions in life: knowledge, consciousness, fate, God, truth, goodness, justice. It is for anyone who believes there are big questions out there, but does not know how to approach them. Think sets out to explain what they are and why they are important. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you knew barely anything about philosophy before reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a wild ride.</description></item><item><title>Amusing Ourselves to Death</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-01/</guid><description>Amusing Ourselves to Death is a book about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse.

To get the most out of it, you might want to pull it out and discuss a thought-experiment with some friends because the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much more than present the thought-experiments one after the other.</description></item><item><title>Media Literacy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</guid><description>Media Literacy teaches you how to navigate through the overwhelming flood of information found in today&amp;rsquo;s media-saturated world.

William Dalrymple acknowledges his white colonialist britishness and seems to mostly stay out of the way and let the people he meets tell their stories.</description></item><item><title>Night</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-03-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-03-01/</guid><description>Elie Wiesel&amp;rsquo;s Night is a retelling of what happened to him during World War 2. In a Nazi death camp, he witnesses the death of his family, the death of his innocence and the death of his God. Night shows you evil at its peak and convinces you that this horror must never be allowed to happen again.</description></item><item><title>Meditations: A New Translation</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-15/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-15/</guid><description>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (a.d. 121–180) succeeded his adoptive father as emperor of Rome in a.d. 161—and in his Meditations he provides insights, wisdom, and practical guidance on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity to interacting with others. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much of his advice has aged well but given his position of supreme power and the changing times (eg. slavery is bad), some of his meditations have not aged so well.</description></item><item><title>The Anthropocene Reviewed</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-01/</guid><description>The Anthropocene Reviewed is a book where author/youtuber John Green reviews a random assortment of things and concepts that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see reviewed. This conceit gives him a lot of room to write about anything he feels like. John Green is an expert at what he does, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find what he does to be very compelling.</description></item><item><title>Because Internet</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-01-20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-01-20/</guid><description>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language discusses how we express ourselves on the internet, how we got here and where we&amp;rsquo;re going from the perspective of a linguist.</description></item><item><title>The Odyssey</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-25/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-25/</guid><description>The Odyssey is a classic and there&amp;rsquo;s more stories that have been inspired by it than I can count.

I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s work generally but I found this to be quite boring.</description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</guid><description>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.</description></item><item><title>The Joy of Mixology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-15/</guid><description>Everything you need to know about mixing cocktails.</description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-01/</guid><description>Stephen King tells you about his life and his advice on how you can become better at writing.

In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Power</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-09-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-09-01/</guid><description>Understanding Power is the book that convinced me that I needed to start reading again. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of transcripts taken from Noam Chomsky Q/A sessions, but man, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I was convinced to sit down and read through it.
Noam Chomsky has eidetic memory (more commonly known as photographic memory) and so you can ask him about anything and he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to perfectly recall everything he&amp;rsquo;s read and written about the subject.</description></item><item><title>Sandcastles</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</guid><description>Sandcastles is the french comic book that the recent M.
