 &lt;p>Whenever he [Moebius] finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spiritual pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mary Gentle&amp;rsquo;s Grunts in a nutshell. Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gilgamesh</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780300268096/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780300268096/</guid><description>&lt;p>An ancient Sumarian/Babylonian bromance for the ages.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who to blame for how boring most of this book is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc. He&amp;rsquo;s great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Murder On The Orient Express - A Hercule Piorot Mystery</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780062073495/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780062073495/</guid><description>&lt;p>Murder on the Orient Express is similar to Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s Death on the Nile (the other Agatha Christie novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both novels involve Hercule Poirot on vacation traveling (on a train or on a boat respectively), with the soon-to-be murder victim asking Poirot for help, him declining and then after the murder occurs, Poirot proceeds to solve the murder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Death on the Nile was SO MUCH MORE of a compelling read for me. Murder on the Orient Express is&amp;hellip; Uhhhhh&amp;hellip; Express, it&amp;rsquo;s fast and straightforward. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time. As soon as possible you&amp;rsquo;re jumping straight into the murder followed by a by-the-numbers solving of the mystery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terry Pratchett: A Life With Footnotes - The Official Biography</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780857526649/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780857526649/</guid><description>&lt;p>Terry Pratchett is an all-timer.

It&amp;rsquo;s got one of the most unsettling POVs I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while. It starts weird and only gets weirder from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great Halloween read. It&amp;rsquo;s got an Adams Family aesthetic (weird family in a mansion ostracized from their community) but with a less comedic tone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vengeful</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765387523/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765387523/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that V.E.

&lt;p>Her Villains duology leaves me feeling empty.

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a retread of the first book with a little bit of the 80s crack epidemic and reganomics commentary spliced into it.

&lt;p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, far from it.

&lt;p>I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain).

Each time I sat down to read, it only took a few sentences to transport me completely into this world that V.E. Schwab has so carefully built.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Gathering of Shadows develops the characters introduced in the previous book (along with some fresh faces), portrays the evolution of their relationships with one another and sets everything up for what I&amp;rsquo;m confident is going to be a riveting conclusion to the trilogy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terminal Alliance</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780756412746/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780756412746/</guid><description>&lt;p>This book is a joke and not a very funny one.

&lt;p>The tonal clash between the comedic intent of the author and the violent story centered around a group of janitors trying to stop a genocide is jarring.&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic romp where we follow free adventures of a ragtag group of scoundrels doing their best to save the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could have been just &amp;ldquo;another one of those&amp;rdquo; is greatly elevated by the Adrian Tchaikovsky touch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Light Brigade</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It subverts many of the science fiction tropes you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with to keep you guessing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</guid><description>&lt;p>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I rolled with it, strapped on my suspension of disbelief pants and enjoyed the ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Death On The Nile</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780062073556/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780062073556/</guid><description>&lt;p>Agatha Christie is described as the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Mystery&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Crime&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading through Death on the Nile for the first time, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend that we add the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Camp&amp;rdquo; to that list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Death on the Nile is one of the funniest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.

 &lt;p>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There&amp;rsquo;s ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in.

It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know) suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Autistic Behaviors</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824141/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824141/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Understanding Autism In Adults And Aging Adults</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Think</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</guid><description>&lt;p>Think is a book about the big questions in life: knowledge, consciousness, fate, God, truth, goodness, justice.
