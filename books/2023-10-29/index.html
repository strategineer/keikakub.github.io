Murder on the Orient Express is&mldr; Uhhhhh&mldr; Express, it&rsquo;s fast and straightforward. It doesn&rsquo;t waste any time. As soon as possible you&rsquo;re jumping straight into the murder followed by a by-the-numbers solving of the mystery.</p><p>It lacks a lot of the charm found in the more patient and denser Death on the Nile. We don&rsquo;t get to learn much about the characters in Murder on the Orient Express which made it hard for me to become invested in them.</p><p>This is very unlike Death on the Nile where more than enough time was spent with each character (whether in a flashback or in a present day scene before or after the murder) allowing me to eventually start to understand them, care about them and understand their motives.</p><p>Murder on the Orient Express feels very bare bones comparatively. That has probably helped it age a little better compared to Death on the Nile because there&rsquo;s less room for Agatha to hang herself with old school racist slurs, with weird pandering to the 1930s female demographic who (I guess?) really wanted to meet a man and get married, with off the wall bizarre dialogue, etc.</p><p>But I kind of enjoyed the parts of Death on the Nile that haven&rsquo;t aged well because those were the bits that stood out to me and were sometimes very funny.</p><p>Both books have pretty wild endings, whether you like one or the other will come down to personal preference but Death on the Nile&rsquo;s ending felt a little more earned and realistic to me compared to Murder on the Orient Express&rsquo;s.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re really interested in the murder mystery bit of murder mystery novels, you&rsquo;d be well served reading both of these novels. But if you would prefer to let the murder simmer a little, letting characters develop, witness wild scenes and dialogue and having a better payoff as a result of all this then you might prefer to read Death on the Nile over Murder on the Orient Express.</p></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-05/>◀️Eyes of the Void</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-28/>▶️Terry Pratchett: A Life with Footnotes</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent books</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-01/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-29/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Child Thief</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-19/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Sword & Citadel: The Second Half of The Book of the New Sun</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Shadow & Claw: The First Half of The Book of the New Sun</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-01-27/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Iliad</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/books>... with 110 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/books/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
