He nodded. &lsquo;She had me dressed up in a suit, toting a gun and shooting at toy missiles which &ldquo;explosively dismantled&rdquo; themselves.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Not at all. I had high hopes for that girl, but too much of that sort of nonsense and I think her intelligence will explosively dismantle.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Well, such diversions aren&rsquo;t for everybody. She was just trying to be helpful. You&rsquo;d said you were feeling restless, looking for something new.&rsquo;</p><p>&lsquo;Well, that wasn&rsquo;t it,&rsquo; Gurgeh said, and felt suddenly, inexplicably, saddened.</p></strong><hr><strong><p>&lsquo;All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains malleable, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo;, such as grid, Prallian scope, &rsquo;nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a relativistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine sentience societies.</p><p>&lsquo;The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attributes of the pieces, is inevitably to shackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it&rsquo;s just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They&rsquo;re just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you&rsquo;ll keep fit at the same time.&rsquo;</p></strong><hr><strong>The game went on. People came and went around him. The web held all his fortune; the little spheres, holding their secret treasures and threats, became like discrete parcels of life and death, single points of probability which could be guessed at but never known until they were challenged, opened, looked at. All reality seemed to hinge on those infinitesimal bundles of meaning.</strong><hr><strong>Three days passed. He couldn&rsquo;t settle to anything. He tried to read papers, old books, the material of his own he&rsquo;d been working on - but on every occasion he found himself reading and re-reading the same piece or page or screen, time and time again, trying hard to take it in but finding his thoughts constantly veering away from the words and diagrams and illustrations in front of him, refusing to absorb anything, going back time and time again to the same treadmill, the same looping, tail-swallowing, eternally pointless round of questioning and regret. Why had he done it? What way out was there?</strong><hr><strong>&lsquo;Jernau Gurgeh,&rsquo; the machine said, making a sighing noise, &lsquo;a guilty system recognises no innocents. As with any power apparatus which thinks everybody&rsquo;s either for it or against it, we&rsquo;re against it. You would be too, if you thought about it. The very way you think places you amongst its enemies. This might not be your fault, because every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximise that effect, and some try to minimise it. You come from one of the latter and you&rsquo;re being asked to explain yourself to one of the former. Prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine; neutrality is probably impossible. You cannot choose not to have the politics you do; they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being; they are a function of your existence. I know that and they know that; you had better accept it.&rsquo;</strong><hr><strong><p>&lsquo;I think I see Shohobohaum Za in the crowd,&rsquo; the drone said as they waited at the exit. Ram&rsquo;s entourage was still cluttering the far end of the ribbon of path held clear by the two lines of policemen.</p><p>Gurgeh glanced at the machine, then down the line of arm-linked police. He was still tensed from the game, bloodstream suffused with multifarious chemicals. As happened every now and again, everything he saw around him seemed to be part of the game; the way people stood like pieces, grouped according to who could take or affect whom; the way the pattern on the marquee was like a simple grid-area on the board, and the poles like planted power-sources waiting to replenish some exhausted minor piece and supporting a crux-point in the game; the way the people and police stood like the suddenly closed jaws of some nightmarish pincer-movement… all was the game, everything was seen in its light, translated into the combative imagery of its language, evaluated in the context its structure imposed upon the mind.</p></strong><hr><strong>Anyway, he was awash with a bitter-sweet flood of new and enhanced emotions; the terror of risk and possible defeat, the sheer exultation of the gamble that paid off and the campaign which triumphed; the horror of suddenly seeing a weakness in his position which could lose him the game; the surge of relief when nobody else noticed and there was time to plug the gap; the pulse of furious, gloating glee when he saw such a weakness in another&rsquo;s game; and the sheer unbridled joy of victory.</strong><hr><strong>Gurgeh saw many cripples. They sat on street corners, selling trinkets, playing music on scratchy, squeaky instruments, or just begging. Some were blind, some had no arms, some had no legs. Gurgeh looked at the damaged people and felt dizzy; the gritty surface of the street beneath him seemed to tip and heave. For a moment it was as though the city, the planet, the whole Empire swirled around him in a frantic spinning tangle of nightmare shapes; a constellation of suffering and anguish, an infernal dance of agony and mutilation.</strong><hr><strong><p>The drone made a sighing noise. The man was still staring at the dead screen. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; the drone said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if what I&rsquo;ve shown you has upset you, Jernau Gurgeh, but I didn&rsquo;t want you to leave here thinking the Empire was just a few venerable game-players, some impressive architecture and a few glorified night-clubs. What you&rsquo;ve seen tonight is also what it&rsquo;s about. And there&rsquo;s plenty in between that I can&rsquo;t show you; all the frustrations that affect the poor and the relatively well-off alike, caused simply because they live in a society where one is not free to do as one chooses. There&rsquo;s the journalist who can&rsquo;t write what he knows is the truth, the doctor who can&rsquo;t treat somebody in pain because they&rsquo;re the wrong sex… a million things every day, things that aren&rsquo;t as melodramatic and gross as what I&rsquo;ve shown you, but which are still part of it, still some of the effects.</p><p>&lsquo;The ship told you a guilty system recognises no innocents. I&rsquo;d say it does. It recognises the innocence of a young child, for example, and you saw how they treated that. In a sense it even recognises the &ldquo;sanctity&rdquo; of the body… but only to violate it. Once again, Gurgeh, it all boils down to ownership, possession; about taking and having.&rsquo; Flere-Imsaho paused, then floated towards Gurgeh, came very close to him. &lsquo;Ah, but I&rsquo;m preaching again, aren&rsquo;t I? The excesses of youth. I&rsquo;ve kept you up late. Maybe you&rsquo;re ready for some sleep now; it&rsquo;s been a long night, hasn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll leave you.&rsquo; It turned and floated away. It stopped near the door again. &lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; it said.</p></strong><hr><strong>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; Hamin nodded. &lsquo;You see, Gurgeh, one can be on either side in the Empire. One can be the player, or one can be… played upon.&rsquo; Hamin smiled at what was a play on words in Eächic, and to some extent in Marain too.</strong><hr><strong><p>Gurgeh watched Groasnachek as it fell away beneath them. The city tilted as he was thrown back into his seat; the whole view swung and juddered as the shuttlecraft powered into the hazy skies.</p><p>Gradually all the patterns and the shapes came out, revealed for a while before the increasing distance, the city&rsquo;s own vapours, dust and grime, and the altering angle of their climb took it all away.</p><p>For all the jumble, it looked momentarily peaceful and ordered in its parts. The distance made its individual, local confusions and dislocations disappear, and from a certain height, where little ever dallied, and almost everything just passed through, it looked exactly like a great, mindless, spreading organism.</p></strong><hr><strong><p>So far so average. Our game-player&rsquo;s lucked out again. I guess you can see he&rsquo;s a changed man, though. These humans! I&rsquo;m going to be consistent, however. I haven&rsquo;t told you who I am so far, and I&rsquo;m not going to tell you now, either. Maybe later.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Does identity matter anyway? I have my doubts. We are what we do, not what we think. Only the interactions count (there is no problem with free will here; that&rsquo;s not incompatible with believing your actions define you). And what is free will anyway? Chance. The random factor. If one is not ultimately predictable, then of course that&rsquo;s all it can be. I get so frustrated with people who can&rsquo;t see this!</p><p>Even a human should be able to understand it&rsquo;s obvious.</p><p>The result is what matters, not how it&rsquo;s achieved (unless, of course, the process of achieving is itself a series of results). What difference does it make whether a mind&rsquo;s made up of enormous, squidgy, animal cells working at the speed of sound (in air!), or from a glittering nanofoam of reflectors and patterns of holographic coherence, at lightspeed? (Let&rsquo;s not even think about a Mind mind.) Each is a machine, each is an organism, each fulfils the same task.</p><p>Just matter, switching energy of one sort or another.</p><p>Switches. Memory. The random element that is chance and that is called choice: common denominators, all.</p><p>I say again; you is what you done. Dynamic (mis)behaviourism, that&rsquo;s my creed.</p><p>Gurgeh? His switches are working funny. He&rsquo;s thinking differently, acting uncharacteristically. He is a different person. He&rsquo;s seen the worst that meatgrinder of a city could provide, and he just took it personally, and took his revenge.</p><p>Now he&rsquo;s spaceborne again, head crammed full of Azad rules, his brain adapted and adapting to the swirling, switching patterns of that seductive, encompassing, feral set of rules and possibilities, and being carted through space towards the Empire&rsquo;s most creakily symbolic shrine: Echronedal; the place of the standing wave of flame; the Fire Planet.</p><p>But will our hero prevail? Can he possibly prevail? And what would constitute winning, anyway?</p><p>How much has the man still got to learn? What will he make of such knowledge? More to the point, what will it make of him?</p><p>Wait and see. It&rsquo;ll work itself out, in time.</p><p>Take it from there, maestro…</p></strong><hr><strong><p>Gurgeh dived back into the game, an amphibian into welcoming
water. For a few moves he just gloried in the feeling of returning home
to his element and the sheer joy of the contest, taking delight in a
flexing of his strengths and powers, the readying tension of the pieces
and places; then he curved out from that playing to the serious
business of the building and the hunting, the making and linking and
the destroying and cutting; the searching and destroying.</p><p>The board became both Culture and Empire again. The setting was
made by them both; a glorious, beautiful, deadly killing field,
unsurpassably fine and sweet and predatory and carved from Nicosar&rsquo;s
beliefs and his together. Image of their minds; a hologram of pure
coherence, burning like a standing wave of fire across the board, a
perfect map of the landscapes of thought and faith within their heads.</p><p>He began the slow move that was defeat and victory together before
he even knew it himself. Nothing so subtle, so complex, so beautiful
had ever been seen on an Azad board. He believed that; he knew that.
He would make it the truth.</p><p>The game went on.</p><p>Breaks, days, evenings, conversations, meals; they came and went in
another dimension; a monochrome thing, a flat, grainy image. He was
somewhere else entirely. Another dimension, another image. His skull
was a blister with a board inside it, his outside self just another piece
to be shuffled here and there.</p></strong></div></article></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-20/>◀️Dogs Of War</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-14/>▶️Paranoia: Core Starter Set (MGP50000)</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
