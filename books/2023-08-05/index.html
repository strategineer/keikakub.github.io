I don&rsquo;t think that was the intention of the author almost one hundred years ago when it was first published but reading it now I was chuckling nonstop at how campy and absurd it is.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s set the scene. Hercules Poiroit, the world famous private investigator specializing in murders, finds himself on a boat on the Nile. He was looking to go on vacation, take a break from his work and relax.</p><p>Unfortunately for M. Poirot, there are more than a dozen rich British people on the boat with him capable of murder.</p><p>Soon enough a murder is committed and then it&rsquo;s up to M. Poirot and his buddy Colonel Race (who also happens to be on the same boat for some reason) to solve the crime.</p><p>Think about what that would actually be like and take a gander at a few scenes I&rsquo;ve picked out which had me rolling on the floor laughing.</p><p>Scene 1:</p><p>Hello world famous private investigator specializing in murder investigations, let me talk to you about who I want to kill in precise detail and also here&rsquo;s the gun I&rsquo;m going to use.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Scene 2:</p><p><strong>“So we&rsquo;ve got to go somewhere.</strong></p><p><strong>[&mldr;] &ldquo;I suppose we might as well go on to Egypt. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.&rdquo;</strong></p><p><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not a matter of life or death,&rdquo; agreed Mrs Otterbourne.</strong></p><p><strong>But there she was quite wrong - for a matter of life and death was exactly what it was.</strong></p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Scene 3:</p><p>**&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mrs Robson. I went over to Paris with Miss Van Schuyler last Fall. But I&rsquo;ve never been to Egypt before.&rdquo; Mrs Robson hesitated.</p><p>&ldquo;I do hope &mdash;&mdash;&ndash; there won&rsquo;t be any &mdash;&mdash;&ndash; trouble.&rdquo;**</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Scene 4:</p><p>Lady who is probably going to die: HELLO M. POIROT, PLEASE HELP ME. EVERYONE HATES ME.</p><p>I&rsquo;M GOING TO DIE.</p><p>I&rsquo;M GOING TO DIE.</p><p>I&rsquo;M GOING TO DIE.</p><p>M. Poirot: Uhhh chill out lady, don&rsquo;t be melodramatic.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Now, after reading through the whole novel some of the absurdity earlier in the book is explained (it&rsquo;s a mystery after all) but there&rsquo;s no explanation for the extreme campiness other than this being a product of its time.</p><p>And, I absolutely loved it.</p><p>What didn&rsquo;t I like?</p><ol><li><p>Well, the book was written by a British lady almost a hundred years ago so unless you&rsquo;re reading a censored version of the text, you should expect a healthy dose of Imperialism with a side of racism.</p></li><li><p>The campiness dries up about halfway through the book and then ramps back up until the finale. I wasn&rsquo;t as interested in the &ldquo;by the numbers solving the mystery&rdquo; part of the story. It was fine, probably good even, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for but I wanted the story to be all camp all the time.</p></li></ol><p>I loved my time with Death on the Nile, if you love camp then you&rsquo;re going to love this book.
