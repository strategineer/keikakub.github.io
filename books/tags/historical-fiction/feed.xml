&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;ve got no actors, no costumes, no sets, no money and little to no intelligence.

Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash&amp;rsquo;s story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Empires Of Sand</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780440236689/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780440236689/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
