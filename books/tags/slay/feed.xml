&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Roadside Picnic</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games! Especially the third one. It&amp;rsquo;s a game I always come back to over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading through the original inspiration for the games was a real pleasure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maybe Next Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-16/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was the first romance novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read. Sometimes you have to unleash your inner mom and read a book by a mom for moms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about as far from a mom as you can get but despite that, Cesca Major pulled me in with her writing in a way that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Dark Age - Technology And The End Of The Future</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>A bleak but compelling investigation on a variety of world ending issues we&amp;rsquo;re facing currently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to be in the right mood for this text but if you are, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to learn something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow &amp; Claw - The First Half Of The Book Of The New Sun</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadow &amp;amp; Claw is an omnibus containing the first half of Gene Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s Book of the New Sun which is a far future sci-fi fantasy epic following the story of Severian the torturer, a self described insane person who has trouble differentiating between reality, his memories and his dreams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Widow</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>Big robots,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>fighting off aliens,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>piloted by pairs of young men and women (mostly boys and girls), with the men draining the life force from the women (often killing them in the process).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu Zetian, eventually becoming the Iron Widow, is sold to the army by her family to become a concubine-pilot. She has a plan to avenge her sister, burn the system to the ground and build it back up again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dayummmmmm this was good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Good Thinking - Why Flawed Logic Puts Us All At Risk And How Critical Thinking Can Save The World</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-08/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-08/</guid><description>&lt;p>A compelling and instructive book on the many logical fallacies we are guilty of committing ourselves and exposed to through the media and internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A book that made me feel as though it was written specifically for me. A must read book that very few people will read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Light Brigade</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-09/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-09/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It subverts many of the science fiction tropes you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with to keep you guessing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard Of Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a, soon-to-be wizard, on a archipelago world. He goes to wizard school and becomes xXx#1_Mage_NAxXx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A classic fantasy story elevated by Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s poetic use of words. Struggles to give women in the story the story they deserve, an issue dealt with in the subsequent novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doorways In The Sand</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-25/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-25/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;You are a living example of the absurdity of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fifth Season</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The mountain that rumbles will roar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Priestdaddy - A Memoir</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-07/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-07/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Going Postal - Discworld Novel 33</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going Postal is my favorite Terry Pratchett novel. I&amp;rsquo;m facepalming right now for not writing my thoughts down about this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cassandra In Reverse - A Novel</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cassandra in Reverse is a novel about a woman in her early 30s with a fascination for Greek mythology who has just been dumped by her boyfriend of 4 months and fired from her job in PR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that moment, something snaps and she gains the ability to go back in time. She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Piranesi</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>I guess this is what happens when a tremendously successful author with a single published novel to her name spends 16 years writing another one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read Susanna Clarke&amp;rsquo;s first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel, as a kid and, now, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten what it was about and if I enjoyed it (or not).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading Piranesi, I&amp;rsquo;m unlikely to forget this one and how I felt reading through it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very human story with Alien aliens, AI/human constructs and time &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Adrian Tchaikovsky story I read and perhaps the best. Once you pick this book up, you won&amp;rsquo;t be putting it back down until it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Being Awesome - A Unified Theory Of How Not To Suck</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-19/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-19/</guid><description>&lt;p>A philosophical exploration of what it means to be awesome and not suck, and a plea for more awesomeness in our personal, social, and public lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Media Literacy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</guid><description>&lt;p>Media Literacy teaches you how to navigate through the overwhelming flood of information found in today&amp;rsquo;s media-saturated world. Drawing from thousands of media research studies, author W. James Potter explores key components to understanding the fascinating world of mass media. Potter presents examples and facts to help you understand how the media operate, how they attract attention, and how they influence you and the public.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths - The Complete And Definitive Edition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Infrastructure - A Guide To The Industrial Landscape</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Infrastructure is a guide to all the major &amp;quot;ecosystems&amp;quot; of our modern industrial world. In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
