Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s Greco-Roman mythical retelling from 2008, way before these kinds of novels became &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and everyone started writing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lavinia tells the story of, well, Lavinia, a character in Vergil&amp;rsquo;s Aeneid who isn&amp;rsquo;t given any speaking lines. Lavinia being such a paper thin character gives Le Guin the opportunity to fill in the many gaps. And, to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, she&amp;rsquo;s done a great job of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ash - A Secret History</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-06-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-06-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ash - A Secret History is by far the longest novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read. When I saw the thickness of the book, the number of lines on each page and the miniscule size of the font, I was scared that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to read through the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All it took for me to get over that fear was reading the first few pages. Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash&amp;rsquo;s story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dogs Of War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>Adrian Tchaikovsky strikes again. Human animal hybrids with developing consciousness. Check. Hive mind consciousnesses. Check. Empathy porn. Check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might enjoy Dogs of War more than Children of Time? It&amp;rsquo;s more efficient and covers many of the same themes with many more interesting characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consider Phlebas</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Iain Banks POV:&lt;/p>

Sometimes you have to unleash your inner mom and read a book by a mom for moms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about as far from a mom as you can get but despite that, Cesca Major pulled me in with her writing in a way that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow &amp; Claw - The First Half Of The Book Of The New Sun</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadow &amp;amp; Claw is an omnibus containing the first half of Gene Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s Book of the New Sun which is a far future sci-fi fantasy epic following the story of Severian the torturer, a self described insane person who has trouble differentiating between reality, his memories and his dreams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Widow</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>Big robots,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>fighting off aliens,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>piloted by pairs of young men and women (mostly boys and girls), with the men draining the life force from the women (often killing them in the process).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu Zetian, eventually becoming the Iron Widow, is sold to the army by her family to become a concubine-pilot. She has a plan to avenge her sister, burn the system to the ground and build it back up again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dayummmmmm this was good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard Of Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a, soon-to-be wizard, on a archipelago world. He goes to wizard school and becomes xXx#1_Mage_NAxXx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A classic fantasy story elevated by Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s poetic use of words. Struggles to give women in the story the story they deserve, an issue dealt with in the subsequent novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fifth Season</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The mountain that rumbles will roar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doorways In The Sand</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-25/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-25/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;You are a living example of the absurdity of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Priestdaddy - A Memoir</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-07/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-07/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Going Postal</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-23/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going Postal is my favorite Terry Pratchett novel. I&amp;rsquo;m facepalming right now for not writing my thoughts down about this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cassandra In Reverse</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cassandra in Reverse is a novel about a woman in her early 30s with a fascination for Greek mythology who has just been dumped by her boyfriend of 4 months and fired from her job in PR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that moment, something snaps and she gains the ability to go back in time. She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Piranesi</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>I guess this is what happens when a tremendously successful author with a single published novel to her name spends 16 years writing another one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read Susanna Clarke&amp;rsquo;s first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel, as a kid and, now, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten what it was about and if I enjoyed it (or not).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading Piranesi, I&amp;rsquo;m unlikely to forget this one and how I felt reading through it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very human story with Alien aliens, AI/human constructs and time &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Adrian Tchaikovsky story I read and perhaps the best. Once you pick this book up, you won&amp;rsquo;t be putting it back down until it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Infrastructure - A Guide To The Industrial Landscape</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Infrastructure is a guide to all the major &amp;ldquo;ecosystems&amp;rdquo; of our modern industrial world. In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
