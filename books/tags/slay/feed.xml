&lt;p>Savage Worlds is the most &amp;ldquo;more than the sum of its parts&amp;rdquo; tabletop roleplaying system I&amp;rsquo;ve played &amp;mdash; it rocks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Service Model</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250290281/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250290281/</guid><description>&lt;p>Charles, a valet robot, is let go from his job and then goes on a journey of self-discovery.

Bishop&amp;rsquo;s The Etched City was &lt;em>sublime&lt;/em>. Novels like this don&amp;rsquo;t get written often and reading them leaves me a changed man. The poetry, the philosophy, the mythic and dream-like nature of the writing have left me completely stunned and in awe of its beauty and depth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under The Dome</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</guid><description>&lt;p>A small American town is trapped under a gigantic forcefield (the Dome).

 &lt;p>I tried to write a book that would keep the pedal consistently to the metal. Nan [King&amp;rsquo;s editor on Under The Dome] understood that, and whenever I weakened, she jammed her foot down on top of mine and yelled (in the margins, as editors are wont to do), &amp;lsquo;Faster, Steve! Faster!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>

Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s Greco-Roman mythical retelling from 2008, way before these kinds of novels became &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and everyone started writing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lavinia tells the story of, well, Lavinia, a character in Vergil&amp;rsquo;s Aeneid who isn&amp;rsquo;t given any speaking lines. Lavinia being such a paper thin character gives Le Guin the opportunity to fill in the many gaps. And, to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, she&amp;rsquo;s done a great job of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ash - A Secret History</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575069015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575069015/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ash - A Secret History is by far the longest novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read. When I saw the thickness of the book, the number of lines on each page and the miniscule size of the font, I was scared that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to read through the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All it took for me to get over that fear was reading the first few pages. Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash&amp;rsquo;s story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dogs Of War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781786693907/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781786693907/</guid><description>&lt;p>Adrian Tchaikovsky strikes again. Human animal hybrids with developing consciousness. Check. Hive mind consciousnesses. Check. Empathy porn. Check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might enjoy Dogs of War more than Children of Time?

&lt;p>Wu Zetian, eventually becoming the Iron Widow, is sold to the army by her family to become a concubine-pilot. She has a plan to avenge her sister, burn the system to the ground and build it back up again.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A classic fantasy story elevated by Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s poetic use of words.

 &lt;p>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The mountain that rumbles will roar.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doorways In The Sand</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781515444985/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781515444985/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>


 &lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You are a living example of the absurdity of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In that moment, something snaps and she gains the ability to go back in time. She becomes like her namesake from myth who could see into the future but was cursed to never be believed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Piranesi</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781526622433/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781526622433/</guid><description>&lt;p>I guess this is what happens when a tremendously successful author with a single published novel to her name spends 16 years writing another one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read Susanna Clarke&amp;rsquo;s first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel, as a kid and, now, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten what it was about and if I enjoyed it (or not).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading Piranesi, I&amp;rsquo;m unlikely to forget this one and how I felt reading through it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781447273301/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781447273301/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very human story with Alien aliens, AI/human constructs and time &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
