Do not skip this one, it&amp;rsquo;s
cool, it&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s wacky, it&amp;rsquo;s begging to be read multiple times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve got the right group, this would make for a great book club book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow &amp; Claw: The First Half of The Book of the New Sun</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-02-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadow &amp;amp; Claw is an omnibus containing the first half of Gene Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s Book of
the New Sun which is a far future sci-fi fantasy epic following the story of
Severian the torturer, a self described insane person who has trouble
differentiating between reality, his memories and his dreams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Canticle for Leibowitz</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-26/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-26/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part 1: Amazing. Seems like this could have easily been an inspiration for the
old school Fallout games I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved. Following one monk through the
post-apocalypse is cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes
hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 3: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten that far yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parable of the Sower</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>A post-apocalyptic story following a messiah-like figure who wishes to both:
survive the horrific world she lives in with ripped from the 90s headlines / Mad
Max roving gangs of murderers and rapists while also founding her own religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uhhhhh very interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that Octavia E. Butler wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to
finish the series. Her work is always interesting if a little uneven.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
