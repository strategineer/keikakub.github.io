&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and uninteresting way.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of the above?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths - The Complete And Definitive Edition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
