wrote five first drafts of a review. They&amp;rsquo;re incomplete but I&amp;rsquo;m posting them
here mostly un-edited (just some typo fixes) for posterity. They&amp;rsquo;re either too
incomplete, too snarky, too snooty or too mean-spirited to post on Goodreads.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Memory Called Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-29/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Memory Called Empire has big &amp;ldquo;Hugo award winner&amp;rdquo; energy: an interesting
premise, consistent and intriguing world building, a promising start and a
propulsive ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I loved my time with it and very excited to dig into the next book in the series
although I suspect that it won&amp;rsquo;t be as good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Consuming Fire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not my favorite John Scalzi novel but it was fun. I prefer when he doubles down
on the absurd and comic modes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This series is not that, although it does have its funny moments, but it&amp;rsquo;s an
enjoyable romp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-06/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-06/</guid><description>&lt;p>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a
lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I rolled with it, strapped on my suspension of disbelief pants and enjoyed
the ride.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
