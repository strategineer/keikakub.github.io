At least you can see this in the first few pages unlike in Emma Newman&amp;rsquo;s previous novel in her Planetfall series, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a mystery detective novel but wants to be one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to its predecessor, After Atlas is way more polished and mostly focuses on developing the interesting parts of the universe but surprisingly retains a super rushed ending that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly come out of nowhere but it feels like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planetfall</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/</guid><description>&lt;p>Constant &amp;ldquo;mystery cucking&amp;rdquo; for 95% of the novel, a super rushed ending and paper-thin antagonists heavily detract from the interesting POV and the &amp;ldquo;promised land&amp;rdquo; religious/scientific colonial premise and setting, which is sadly a little underdeveloped.&lt;/p>

To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc. He&amp;rsquo;s great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Martian</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780593357132/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780593357132/</guid><description>&lt;p>An astronaut is abandoned on Mars after a dust storm separates him from his crew.

&lt;p>The tonal clash between the comedic intent of the author and the violent story centered around a group of janitors trying to stop a genocide is jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters are nothing more than caricatures and this is a trainwreck waiting to happen given the inclusion of a comic relief autistic character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shards Of Earth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316705851/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316705851/</guid><description>&lt;p>A great space opera by the king of writing alien aliens. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic romp where we follow free adventures of a ragtag group of scoundrels doing their best to save the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could have been just &amp;ldquo;another one of those&amp;rdquo; is greatly elevated by the Adrian Tchaikovsky touch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Light Brigade</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It subverts many of the science fiction tropes you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with to keep you guessing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</guid><description>&lt;p>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I rolled with it, strapped on my suspension of disbelief pants and enjoyed the ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lathe Of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello?

 &lt;p>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was OK.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781447273301/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781447273301/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very human story with Alien aliens, AI/human constructs and time &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
