They&rsquo;re either too incomplete, too snarky, too snooty or too mean-spirited to post on Goodreads.
My ideal review would be very short, just focus on my complaints (the book was probably rushed to the printing press due to the unexpected acclaim received by the previous book and suffers from poor editing/polish especially in the middle of the text because of this) without giving any examples.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/space-opera/>Space Opera</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/trash/>Trash</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-11/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/books/2024-04-03/thumbnail_hu46bb0557c80837fdb0746b55e2ac173e_97755_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/>Roadside Picnic

Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.
There&rsquo;s a little bit of tension as the crew navigates to each planet they&rsquo;ve been tasked with scouring for life. Will they be ok? What will they find? Etc.

Let&rsquo;s set the stage (you can read all of this on the front cover so no spoilers):
In Space Opera, an intergalactic World War 2-standin breaks out, causing much destruction and suffering (while humans remain woefully unaware of this).
As a result of this confrontation, the remaining alien civilizations unite and organize a Eurovision-esque contest (the Metagalactic Grand Prix) to determine how the resources of the galaxy will be shared amongst the participants for the following year (based on their relative ranking in contest).<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-07/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/books/2023-06-03/thumbnail_hu4149a8142e6873ef19e5ef037b94ab02_233894_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/>Children of Ruin

If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be missing out.
Both novels take place in universes that feel very grounded in reality. The way in which the various species present evolve over time, communicate with each other, perceive the world around them and interact with it, feels satisfyingly plausible while simultaneously feeling truly alien.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/books/2023-05-20/thumbnail_hua1e06c33a6d7b25580489424d0508624_220725_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/>Children of Time
