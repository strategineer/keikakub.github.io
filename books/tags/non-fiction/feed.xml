The rare case of an author who is immensely popular for the right reasons.
This is a biography about him, and it&amp;rsquo;s the best one we&amp;rsquo;re going to get, written by the best person for the job (other than Terry Pratchett himself of course), his assistant Rob Wilkins.
It is what it says it is, the story of Terry Pratchett from the beginning to the very end.</description></item><item><title>Words are my Matter</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</guid><description>1/3 essays about life 1/3 book forewords 1/3 book reviews
All written by Ursula K. Le Guin between 2000 and 2016.
Ursula K. Le Guin is great so by the transitive property this text is also great.
As Le Guin writes in the book itself, the forewords and reviews she&amp;rsquo;s written here shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be misconstrued as recommendations per say.
But from reading the text, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to tell the difference between her really liking a book/author vs.</description></item><item><title>The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-20/</guid><description>A collection of thoughts on the practice of bouldering, bringing it into conversation with arts and sports as varied as architecture, dance, skateboarding, painting, parkour, martial arts and gymnastics.</description></item><item><title>Aesthetic Life and Why It Matters (Thinking Art)</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-10-03/</guid><description>We all enjoy (and love to comment on) our experiences with media, cuisine, design, games and more.

Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there seems to be a grain of truth (for me, at least). It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know) suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.</description></item><item><title>Think</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-15/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-15/</guid><description>Think is a book about the big questions in life: knowledge, consciousness, fate, God, truth, goodness, justice. It is for anyone who believes there are big questions out there, but does not know how to approach them. Think sets out to explain what they are and why they are important. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you knew barely anything about philosophy before reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a wild ride.</description></item><item><title>Amusing Ourselves to Death</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-05-01/</guid><description>Amusing Ourselves to Death is a book about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse.

To get the most out of it, you might want to pull it out and discuss a thought-experiment with some friends because the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much more than present the thought-experiments one after the other.</description></item><item><title>Media Literacy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-04-07/</guid><description>Media Literacy teaches you how to navigate through the overwhelming flood of information found in today&amp;rsquo;s media-saturated world.

In a Nazi death camp, he witnesses the death of his family, the death of his innocence and the death of his God.

It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much of his advice has aged well but given his position of supreme power and the changing times (eg. slavery is bad), some of his meditations have not aged so well.</description></item><item><title>The Anthropocene Reviewed</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-01/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-02-01/</guid><description>The Anthropocene Reviewed is a book where author/youtuber John Green reviews a random assortment of things and concepts that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see reviewed. This conceit gives him a lot of room to write about anything he feels like. John Green is an expert at what he does, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find what he does to be very compelling.</description></item><item><title>Because Internet</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-01-20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-01-20/</guid><description>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language discusses how we express ourselves on the internet, how we got here and where we&amp;rsquo;re going from the perspective of a linguist.</description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</guid><description>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.</description></item><item><title>The Joy of Mixology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-15/</guid><description>Everything you need to know about mixing cocktails.</description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-11-01/</guid><description>Stephen King tells you about his life and his advice on how you can become better at writing. This amounts to him basically saying &amp;ldquo;Just write a lot bro&amp;rdquo; but despite this, this was quite a fun read. And&amp;hellip; He&amp;rsquo;s not wrong.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-10-01/</guid><description>Infrastructure is a guide to all the major &amp;ldquo;ecosystems&amp;rdquo; of our modern industrial world. In exploring railroad tracks, antenna towers, highway overpasses, power lines, coal mines, nuclear power plants, grain elevators, oil refineries, steel mills, and more, Brian Hayes reveals how our familiar and often-overlooked industrial environment can be as dazzling as nature.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Power</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-09-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-09-01/</guid><description>Understanding Power is the book that convinced me that I needed to start reading again. It&amp;rsquo;s just a bunch of transcripts taken from Noam Chomsky Q/A sessions, but man, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I was convinced to sit down and read through it.
Noam Chomsky has eidetic memory (more commonly known as photographic memory) and so you can ask him about anything and he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to perfectly recall everything he&amp;rsquo;s read and written about the subject.</description></item></channel></rss>
