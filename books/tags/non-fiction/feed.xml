Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there seems to be a grain of truth (for me, at least). It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know) suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Autistic Behaviors</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824141/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824141/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Understanding Autism In Adults And Aging Adults</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781946824912/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Think</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</guid><description>&lt;p>Think is a book about the big questions in life: knowledge, consciousness, fate, God, truth, goodness, justice. It is for anyone who believes there are big questions out there, but does not know how to approach them. Think sets out to explain what they are and why they are important. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you knew barely anything about philosophy before reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a wild ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amusing Ourselves To Death</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780143036531/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780143036531/</guid><description>&lt;p>Amusing Ourselves to Death is a book about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse.

To get the most out of it, you might want to pull it out and discuss a thought-experiment with some friends because the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much more than present the thought-experiments one after the other.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Media Literacy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781483379326/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781483379326/</guid><description>&lt;p>Media Literacy teaches you how to navigate through the overwhelming flood of information found in today&amp;rsquo;s media-saturated world.

It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much of his advice has aged well but given his position of supreme power and the changing times (eg. slavery is bad), some of his meditations have not aged so well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Anthropocene Reviewed</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780525555216/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780525555216/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Anthropocene Reviewed is a book where author/youtuber John Green reviews a random assortment of things and concepts that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see reviewed. This conceit gives him a lot of room to write about anything he feels like. John Green is an expert at what he does, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find what he does to be very compelling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Because Internet</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735210936/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735210936/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language discusses how we express ourselves on the internet, how we got here and where we&amp;rsquo;re going from the perspective of a linguist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art Of Strategy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393337174/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393337174/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Joy Of Mixology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780451499028/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780451499028/</guid><description>&lt;p>Everything you need to know about mixing cocktails.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982159375/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982159375/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stephen King tells you about his life and his advice on how you can become better at writing.
