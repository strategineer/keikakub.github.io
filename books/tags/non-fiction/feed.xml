&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K.

This conceit gives him a lot of room to write about anything he feels like. John Green is an expert at what he does, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find what he does to be very compelling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Because Internet</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735210936/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735210936/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language discusses how we express ourselves on the internet, how we got here and where we&amp;rsquo;re going from the perspective of a linguist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art Of Strategy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393337174/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393337174/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Joy Of Mixology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780451499028/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780451499028/</guid><description>&lt;p>Everything you need to know about mixing cocktails.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982159375/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982159375/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stephen King tells you about his life and his advice on how you can become better at writing.
