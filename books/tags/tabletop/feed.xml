Seems like this would be great for one-shots (or potentially longer campaigns) with people with any level of experience in roleplaying because the rules are so simple yet exciting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Paranoia: Core Starter Set (MGP50000)</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781908460646/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781908460646/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve played the Paranoia RPG more than a few times, it&amp;rsquo;s always a blast. If you&amp;rsquo;re into chaotic, goofy, absurdist, comically dystopian settings and cooperative/competitive roleplaying systems then you&amp;rsquo;ll love Paranoia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimate Micro-RPG Book - 40 Fast, Easy, And Fun Tabletop Games</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781507212868/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781507212868/</guid><description>&lt;p>A collection of small one shot tabletop RPGs.

Hunt high school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully. It seems OK, nothing extraordinary or unique other than the conceit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heart - The City Beneath</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781913032111/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781913032111/</guid><description>&lt;p>Heart: The City Beneath is a tabletop game about delving into a nightmare undercity that will give you everything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed of – or kill you in the process. It is a dungeon-crawling, story-forward tabletop RPG that focuses on what characters have to lose in pursuit of their dreams in the chaotic darkness beneath the world. Weird but in a good way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Warhammer 40,000 - In The Grim Darkness Of The Far Future There Is Only War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781785818493/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781785818493/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stars Without Number</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936673933/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936673933/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Blades In The Dark</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781613171325/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781613171325/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781633442801/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781633442801/</guid><description>&lt;p>A tabletop roleplaying system where everyone tries to one-up each other with increasingly ridiculous stories about their adventures and exploits in their roles as Georgian/Victorian era noble people.&lt;/p>
