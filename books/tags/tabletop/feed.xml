Hunt high school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully. It seems OK, nothing extraordinary or unique other than the conceit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heart - The City Beneath</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-16/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-08-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Heart: The City Beneath is a tabletop game about delving into a nightmare undercity that will give you everything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed of – or kill you in the process. It is a dungeon-crawling, story-forward tabletop RPG that focuses on what characters have to lose in pursuit of their dreams in the chaotic darkness beneath the world. Weird but in a good way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Warhammer 40,000 - In The Grim Darkness Of The Far Future There Is Only War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-09-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-09-01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stars Without Number</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-06-02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-06-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Blades In The Dark</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-03-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2019-03-01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen - Told in the Form of a New Style of Game Termed Rôle-play</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2016-05-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2016-05-01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fate - Core System</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2014-06-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2014-06-01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dungeons And Dragons Player's Handbook</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2010-09-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2010-09-01/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
