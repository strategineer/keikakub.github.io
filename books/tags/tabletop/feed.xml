&lt;p>Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve got experience GMing, there&amp;rsquo;s so much knowledge in this book and it&amp;rsquo;s expressed so clearly that you&amp;rsquo;ll undoubtly learn a bunch reading it, no matter what kind of games you&amp;rsquo;re interesting in running.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lazy DM's Companion</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9798848677645/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9798848677645/</guid><description>&lt;p>A tiny collection of punched up blog posts on DMing from Micheal Shea.

There&amp;rsquo;s a succinctness and clarity to the rules which also seems to cover all the bases unlike other OSR systems I&amp;rsquo;ve read.
