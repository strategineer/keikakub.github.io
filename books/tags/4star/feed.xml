Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s conclusion to her fantastic Earthsea series. Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve everything.

To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc. He&amp;rsquo;s great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blindness</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156007757/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156007757/</guid><description>&lt;p>José Saramago refuses to use quotation marks, question marks and exclamation marks in his writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic romp where we follow free adventures of a ragtag group of scoundrels doing their best to save the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could have been just &amp;ldquo;another one of those&amp;rdquo; is greatly elevated by the Adrian Tchaikovsky touch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Light Brigade</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481447966/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Light Brigade is a story about breaking people down and putting them back together again, both mentally and physically, to turn them into perfect soldiers/monsters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a wild ride that kept me hooked all throughout. It subverts many of the science fiction tropes you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with to keep you guessing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lathe Of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello?

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Not thinking like us, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Well that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
