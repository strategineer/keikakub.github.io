&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric
beliefs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and
uninteresting way.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of the above?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Secret Of The Golden Flower: A Chinese Book Of Life</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-25/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-25/</guid><description>&lt;ol>

Seems like this could have easily been an inspiration for the
old school Fallout games I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved. Following one monk through the
post-apocalypse is cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes
hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 3: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten that far yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being And Nothingness</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-25/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-25/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not my cup of tea. Philosophy should be understandable, this text is
incomprehensible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe if was downing absinthe with Sartre and his crew back in the forties when
this was written, I would &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; it. As-is though, this is pretty hard to get
through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everyday Ethics - Inspired Solutions To Real-Life Dilemmas</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-18/</guid><description>&lt;p>Joshua Halberstam is the king of strawmanning. Every chapter involves him
describing these absurd caricatures of human beings and then using them to try
to say to something interesting (keyword: try).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Games - Agency As Art</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-14/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2022-09-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>Games are a unique art form. They do not just tell stories, nor are they simply
conceptual art. They are the art form that works in the medium of agency. C. Thi
Nguyen&amp;rsquo;s Games: Agency as Art dives deep into these ideas and expands on them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
