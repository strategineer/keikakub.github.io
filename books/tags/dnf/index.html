Joshua Halberstam is the king of strawmanning. Every chapter involves him describing these absurd caricatures of human beings and then using them to try to say to something interesting (keyword: try).
What is presented here is not &ldquo;inspired solutions to real-life dilemmas&rdquo; but &ldquo;thoughts and comments on fabricated dilemmas the author came up with&rdquo;.
