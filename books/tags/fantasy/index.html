Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.

This series is advertised as a story for kids but it&rsquo;s written in such a way that it&rsquo;s just as interesting reading through it as an adult. A younger reader wouldn&rsquo;t catch all the subtext (and there&rsquo;s a lot of it) consciously.</p><p>As the oldest kid (11 years old) in his family, Gregor is tasked with taking care of his 2 year old baby sister over the summer while his single mother (Gregor&rsquo;s father &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; one night) works to put food on the table.</p><p>His grandmother lives with them and has Dementia (although Gregor doesn&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s what it is).</p><p><strong>For the last year his grandma had been slipping in and out of reality. One minute she was clear as a bell and the next she was calling him Simon. Who was Simon? He had no idea.</strong></p><p>Gregor doesn&rsquo;t speak like a child, in a lot of ways he&rsquo;s a grown ass man in a boy&rsquo;s body. Children don&rsquo;t speak like this:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Great, Day One and I&rsquo;m looking forward to a trip to the laundry room,&rdquo; Gregor thought. &ldquo;By September, I&rsquo;ll probably be ecstatic when we get the phone bill.&rdquo;</strong></p><p>This is fine because:</p><ol><li>It makes it easier for me to step into Gregor&rsquo;s shoes.</li><li>It makes him more interesting.</li><li>Trauma forces you to grow up quicker than normal.</li></ol><p>Gregor is old at heart and he&rsquo;s been through some shit. He&rsquo;s depressed as hell because he misses his dad.</p><p><strong>Gregor tried to remember the last time he&rsquo;d felt as happy as Boots did with her ball. He had had some decent times over the past couple of years. [&mldr;] But if he was honest with himself, Gregor knew it had been years since he&rsquo;d felt real happiness.</strong></p><p>THIS IS A BOOK FOR CHILDREN, PLEASE SEND HELP!</p><p>Not only has Gregor been through &ldquo;some&rdquo; shit, he&rsquo;s about to go through &ldquo;the&rdquo; shit because each book involves Gregor going on a military/diplomatic mission in a world at war, or about to be at war.</p><div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fantasy/>Fantasy</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/middle-grade/>Middle-Grade</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-21/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-18/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=265 height=400 src=/books/2023-08-18/thumbnail_hu09622917c1efc91a40443d6928884f43_203071_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-18/>A Gathering of Shadows

Terry Pratchett</a></h2><div>Date read: Wed, Jul 12, 2023</div><div><p><strong>It would be a lot simpler [&mldr;] if this was a story. A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.</strong></p><p><strong>But this was real life. The world didn&rsquo;t turn, it just went into a spin.</strong></p><p>Thud! by Terry Pratchett tells the story of Sam Vimes, head of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, and his fellow coppers trying to solve a dwarf&rsquo;s murder. The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.</p><p>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There&rsquo;s ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it&rsquo;s a little grittier and darker than usual.</p><p>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.</p><p>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.</p><p>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that&rsquo;s just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.</p><div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fantasy/>Fantasy</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/comic/>Comic</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-03/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=256 height=400 src=/books/2023-07-03/thumbnail_huad877e8a787ebfa73b340d0ee7db7a0a_239540_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-03/>Small Gods

Terry Pratchett</a></h2><div>Date read: Mon, Jul 3, 2023</div><div>Terry is dedicated to the bit. More than anything he is committed to creating absurd worlds that feel real. His work has aged beautifully because the world we live in is as absurd as it&rsquo;s ever been and it&rsquo;s only getting more absurd from here on out.
Small Gods is about an autistic savant (pour a drink every time Terry Pratchett includes an autistic character in one of his Discworld books) named Brutha who is a lowly priest/monk in the church of Om.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fantasy/>Fantasy</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/comic/>Comic</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-03/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-24/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=257 height=400 src=/books/2023-06-24/thumbnail_huf1f8a9fdf7cf0918a81062c6fb6f5c6c_146226_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-24/>Thief of Time
