Both novels involve Hercule Poirot on vacation traveling (on a train or on a boat respectively), with the soon-to-be murder victim asking Poirot for help, him declining and then after the murder occurs, Poirot proceeds to solve the murder.
But Death on the Nile was SO MUCH MORE of a compelling read for me.</description></item><item><title>Death on the Nile</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-05/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>me@strategineer.com (Strategineer)</author><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-05/</guid><description>Agatha Christie is described as the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Mystery&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Crime&amp;rdquo;.
After reading through Death on the Nile for the first time, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend that we add the &amp;ldquo;Queen of Camp&amp;rdquo; to that list.
Death on the Nile is one of the funniest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that was the intention of the author almost one hundred years ago when it was first published but reading it now I was chuckling nonstop at how campy and absurd it is.</description></item></channel></rss>
