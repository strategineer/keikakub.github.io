I told him firmly - and as though I were slightly shocked by the suggestion - that I had never considered it. It was a lie. I had known, as all the apprentices knew, that one was not firmly and finally a member of the guild until one consented as an adult to the connection.</description></item><item><title>Gideon the Ninth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-18/</guid><description>A murder mystery set in a Warhammer 40k-esque far far future universe setting with necromancy at the core of everything. Also it&amp;rsquo;s horny but not explicitly so.
This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.
It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, far from it. It&amp;rsquo;s just inconsistent and a little long.
The setting is cool in theory but in execution I&amp;rsquo;m left feeling as though it&amp;rsquo;s internally inconsistent (and so, less believable than it could be otherwise).</description></item><item><title>The Obelisk Gate</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-24/</guid><description>This novel suffers from middle book syndrome. It continues the story set up in the first book and, hopefully, sets up the third and final book.
Unlike The Fifth Season, this novel fails to coalesce the different POVs into a cohesive whole which was one of the best aspects of the first book.
The Obelisk Gate feels like two different stories that were spliced into each other and suffers for it.</description></item><item><title>The Fifth Season</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</guid><description>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The mountain that rumbles will roar.
The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.
The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.
They&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;orogenes&amp;rdquo;, people born with the ability to exert control over stone, often, in exchange of their own life force and of the people around them.</description></item></channel></rss>
