Do not skip this one, it&amp;rsquo;s cool, it&amp;rsquo;s funny, it&amp;rsquo;s wacky, it&amp;rsquo;s begging to be read multiple times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve got the right group, this would make for a great book club book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shadow &amp; Claw - The First Half Of The Book Of The New Sun</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250781253/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250781253/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shadow &amp;amp; Claw is an omnibus containing the first half of Gene Wolfe&amp;rsquo;s Book of the New Sun which is a far future sci-fi fantasy epic following the story of Severian the torturer, a self described insane person who has trouble differentiating between reality, his memories and his dreams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gideon The Ninth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250313188/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781250313188/</guid><description>&lt;p>A murder mystery set in a Warhammer 40k-esque far far future universe setting with necromancy at the core of everything. Also it&amp;rsquo;s horny but not explicitly so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, far from it. It&amp;rsquo;s just inconsistent and a little long.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Obelisk Gate</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316229265/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316229265/</guid><description>&lt;p>This novel suffers from middle book syndrome. It continues the story set up in the first book and, hopefully, sets up the third and final book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fifth Season</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316229296/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316229296/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The mountain that rumbles will roar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
