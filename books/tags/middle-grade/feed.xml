I was blown away by her YA novel Iron Window a few
months ago so when I saw her next novel Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor on
sale, I snatched it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, Xiran has interwoven ancient Chinese history and mythology
seamlessly with an anime inspired aesthetic (Yugioh in this case whereas Iron
Window was very Darling in the Franxx) serving it all through a genre
appropriate lens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gregor The Overlander</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s heartbreaking. I&amp;rsquo;m tearing up by page 4. This series is advertised as a
story for kids but it&amp;rsquo;s written in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s just as interesting
reading through it as an adult. A younger reader wouldn&amp;rsquo;t catch all the subtext
(and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of it).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
