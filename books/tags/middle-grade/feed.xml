I was blown away by her YA novel Iron Window a few months ago so when I saw her next novel Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor on sale, I snatched it up.
Once again, Xiran has interwoven ancient Chinese history and mythology seamlessly with an anime inspired aesthetic (Yugioh in this case whereas Iron Window was very Darling in the Franxx) serving it all through a genre appropriate lens.</description></item><item><title>Gregor The Overlander</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s heartbreaking. I&amp;rsquo;m tearing up by page four. This series is advertised as a story for kids but it&amp;rsquo;s written in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s just as interesting reading through it as an adult. A younger reader wouldn&amp;rsquo;t catch all the subtext (and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of it) consciously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the oldest kid (11 years old) in his family, Gregor is tasked with taking care of his 2 year old baby sister over the summer while his single mother (Gregor&amp;rsquo;s father &amp;ldquo;disappeared&amp;rdquo; one night) works to put food on the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His grandmother lives with them and has Dementia (although Gregor doesn&amp;rsquo;t know that&amp;rsquo;s what it is).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For the last year his grandma had been slipping in and out of reality. One minute she was clear as a bell and the next she was calling him Simon. Who was Simon? He had no idea.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gregor doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak like a child, in a lot of ways he&amp;rsquo;s a grown ass man in a boy&amp;rsquo;s body. Children don&amp;rsquo;t speak like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Great, Day One and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to a trip to the laundry room,&amp;rdquo; Gregor thought. &amp;ldquo;By September, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be ecstatic when we get the phone bill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is fine because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It makes it easier for me to step into Gregor&amp;rsquo;s shoes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It makes him more interesting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trauma forces you to grow up quicker than normal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Gregor is old at heart and he&amp;rsquo;s been through some shit. He&amp;rsquo;s depressed as hell because he misses his dad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gregor tried to remember the last time he&amp;rsquo;d felt as happy as Boots did with her ball. He had had some decent times over the past couple of years. [&amp;hellip;] But if he was honest with himself, Gregor knew it had been years since he&amp;rsquo;d felt real happiness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>THIS IS A BOOK FOR CHILDREN, PLEASE SEND HELP!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not only has Gregor been through &amp;ldquo;some&amp;rdquo; shit, he&amp;rsquo;s about to go through &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; shit because each book involves Gregor going on a military/diplomatic mission in a world at war, or about to be at war.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
