Suffers from being a little bit too predictable for my taste.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who to blame for how boring most of this book is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and uninteresting way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of the above?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Iliad</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781324001805/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781324001805/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love Greek mythology which definitely elevated my appreciation of this text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re not already a big fan of Greek mythology, you&amp;rsquo;re unlikely to get much out of it though.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Circe</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781408890042/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781408890042/</guid><description>&lt;p>Madeline Miller, the first and the greatest of the authors writing Greek mythology fan fiction, like the hammer of Hephaestus, strikes again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Circe rewrites the story of, well, Circe who you may have seen in Homer&amp;rsquo;s Odyssey. It was fantastic and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to read her previous novel, the Song of Achilles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Odyssey</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393356250/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393356250/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Odyssey is a classic and there&amp;rsquo;s more stories that have been inspired by it than I can count. After reading it, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see it echoed everywhere you look.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Norse Mythology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393356182/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780393356182/</guid><description>&lt;p>Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s Norse Mythology is a retelling of a few stories from Norse mythology (which we don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about). I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s work generally but I found this to be quite boring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780241982358/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780241982358/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
