Orwell&amp;rsquo;s 1984.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not as prophetic as Aldous Huxley&amp;rsquo;s Brave New World but it&amp;rsquo;s more consistently
well written and has mostly aged better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s more open to interpretation than I was expecting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Roadside Picnic</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games! Especially the third one. It&amp;rsquo;s a game I always
come back to over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading through the original inspiration for the games was a real pleasure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Futurological Congress (From The Memoirs Of Ijon Tichy)</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-13/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stanislaw Lem pops off once again. I&amp;rsquo;m blown away at how he can integrate all
these disparate emotions and ideas into one novel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of
the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of
Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and
interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant
colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was
breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
