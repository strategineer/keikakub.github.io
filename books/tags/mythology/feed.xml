I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who to blame exactly for how boring most of the parts of this book are: the British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish, the Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs, or Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and uninteresting way.
All I know is that I DNF this one at around the 70% mark, life&amp;rsquo;s too short.</description></item><item><title>The Greek Myths</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-01/</guid><description>Robert Graves&amp;rsquo;s The Greek Myths is more of an encyclopedia about everything related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then this is the book for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
