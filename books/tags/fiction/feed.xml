It&amp;rsquo;s written in modern English making it easy to read. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It&amp;rsquo;s a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.</description></item><item><title>Norse Mythology</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-15/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-12-15/</guid><description>Unlike Greek mythology, we don&amp;rsquo;t have many written records describing Norse mythology as it existed. So, there&amp;rsquo;s not really much we know about Norse mythology.
In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.
It&amp;rsquo;s OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman&amp;rsquo;s work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work.</description></item><item><title>Sandcastles</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</guid><description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Sandcastles. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels. I&amp;rsquo;m either too stupid to understand what it&amp;rsquo;s trying to say or it&amp;rsquo;s not trying to say anything at all. Either way, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make me feel anything&amp;hellip; Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m dead inside?</description></item><item><title>Remina</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-15/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-15/</guid><description>Junji Ito is cool. Uzumaki is great. A lot of his other work is just OK. I think Remina is also just OK.</description></item><item><title>The Drifting Classroom</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-01/</guid><description>The Drifting Classroom is a Japanese horror manga series published from 1972 to 1974 that follows a school (and its students) that is mysteriously transported through time to a post-apocalyptic future.</description></item></channel></rss>
