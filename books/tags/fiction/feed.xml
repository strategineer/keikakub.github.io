I love Greek mythology so I liked this a lot.
I read through it out loud for about half of it and then finished the rest silently because it was taking me too long.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure the author would recommend the audiobook because this is a story best told orally.</description></item><item><title>The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-27/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-27/</guid><description/></item><item><title>All's Well</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-15/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-15/</guid><description>50 pages in I&amp;rsquo;m appreciating the depiction of the alienation Miranda feels towards others caused by her chronic pain which is invisible to everyone else to very real to her.</description></item><item><title>Circe</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-12-01/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wuthering Heights</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-23/</guid><description>DNF on page 7

Christ is implied to have existed in this universe so that&amp;rsquo;s a little confusing. Where and when are we then? But it feels like an alternate fantastical reality.
Inverting tropes: instead of a prince saving a princess, the princess wants to kill the prince and save her sister.</description></item><item><title>Guards!

I liked this one quite a bit. After reading Thud! and enjoying that, I decided to start reading the entire Discworld City/Night Watch series. Captain Vimes, Carrot, Sergeant Colon and Nobby are great characters.
Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.

To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.
Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.
He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc.</description></item><item><title>Murder on the Orient Express</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/</guid><description>Murder on the Orient Express is similar to Agatha Christie&amp;rsquo;s Death on the Nile (the other Agatha Christie novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently).
Both novels involve Hercule Poirot on vacation traveling (on a train or on a boat respectively), with the soon-to-be murder victim asking Poirot for help, him declining and then after the murder occurs, Poirot proceeds to solve the murder.
But Death on the Nile was SO MUCH MORE of a compelling read for me.</description></item><item><title>A Canticle for Leibowitz</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-26/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-26/</guid><description>Part 1: Amazing. Seems like this could have easily been an inspiration for the old school Fallout games I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved. Following one monk through the post-apocalypse is cool.
Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.
Part 3: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten that far yet.

I&amp;rsquo;ll have to get back to this eventually, it has a lot of potential but it was a challenge for me to read initially.</description></item><item><title>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-23/</guid><description>It was strange to be inside myself, walking steadily and rigidly past the fence, putting my feet down strongly but without haste that they might have noticed, to be inside and know that they were looking at me; I was hiding very far inside but I could hear them and see them still from one corner of my eye.

&amp;hellip;
There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that V.E. Schwab is a great writer. She&amp;rsquo;s able to construct stories that entice you to keep reading even though the underlying story isn&amp;rsquo;t all it&amp;rsquo;s cracked up to be.

José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.
José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>Gideon the Ninth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-18/</guid><description>A murder mystery set in a Warhammer 40k-esque far far future universe setting with necromancy at the core of everything. Also it&amp;rsquo;s horny but not explicitly so.
This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.
It&amp;rsquo;s not bad, far from it. It&amp;rsquo;s just inconsistent and a little long.
The setting is cool in theory but in execution I&amp;rsquo;m left feeling as though it&amp;rsquo;s internally inconsistent (and so, less believable than it could be otherwise).</description></item><item><title>The Martian</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-14/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-14/</guid><description>An astronaut is abandoned on Mars after a dust storm separates him from his crew. Through journal entries, he tells the story of how he tries to survive.
The story starts out a bit dry but it starts to shine once people on Earth realize he&amp;rsquo;s alive and begin to make plans to rescue him. The POV shifts around between the &amp;ldquo;Martian&amp;rdquo;, the NASA employees trying to save him and the members of the crew that left him behind.</description></item><item><title>Cain</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</guid><description>Atheist fan fiction written about the Old Testament.
Cain, the murderer of Abel, wanders around iconic moments from the Old Testament (Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark, the Tower of Babel, Sodom, Jericho, etc.) and points out how the God of the Old Testament is fucked up and not worth worshipping.
This is kind of a weird one. I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jose Saramago is going to be converting anyone with this text. It&amp;rsquo;s short, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious and a fan of Jose Saramago, go for it.</description></item><item><title>Lilith's Brood</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-10/</guid><description>Dawn - 5 stars Adulthood Rites - 3 stars Imago - 3 stars
What follows is mostly me rambling about the series.
I was blown away by the premise of Dawn and its execution. The remnants of humanity, after a nuclear apocalypse occurs, are &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo; by aliens and forced to choose between mating with their saviors or never being able to have children again.
This series is about biological determinism, consent, imbalanced power dynamics and sexual violence (among other things).</description></item><item><title>Vicious</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-27/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-27/</guid><description>In Vicious, V. E. Schwab writes some great prose and hooks you with a lot of writing gimmicks (past, present and future POVs, extremely convenient circumstances/decisions to set up exciting scenes, etc.) but she struggles to create a believable narrative with likeable characters.
Almost every character is straight from the Build-Your-Own-Fan-Fiction factory which would be fine but they have more in common with cardboard cutouts than living breathing characters.
The premise of the story and the way the story is told is as edgy as possible.</description></item><item><title>The Martian Chronicles</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-26/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-26/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Raven Tower</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-25/</guid><description>NB: &amp;ldquo;The Raven Tower&amp;rdquo; is one of the worst books I have ever read.

I&amp;rsquo;m tearing up by page four. This series is advertised as a story for kids but it&amp;rsquo;s written in such a way that it&amp;rsquo;s just as interesting reading through it as an adult. A younger reader wouldn&amp;rsquo;t catch all the subtext (and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of it) consciously.
As the oldest kid (11 years old) in his family, Gregor is tasked with taking care of his 2 year old baby sister over the summer while his single mother (Gregor&amp;rsquo;s father &amp;ldquo;disappeared&amp;rdquo; one night) works to put food on the table.</description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-20/</guid><description>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.

I enjoyed it but it was missing a bit of polish.
I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain). It&amp;rsquo;s not something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to&amp;hellip; or both).
The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a story for a younger demographic though &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I&amp;rsquo;ve read some erotica in my day but this was something else).</description></item><item><title>All the Names</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-16/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-16/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Iron Widow</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/</guid><description>Big robots,

The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of pleasure and peace in a broken world.
The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of circumstances outside of their control.

It fails completely in its stated goal of being funny.

My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.

Death on the Nile is one of the funniest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.

He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).</description></item><item><title>The Obelisk Gate</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</guid><description>spoiler alert This novel suffers from middle book syndrome. It continues the story set up in the first book and, hopefully, sets up the third and final book.
Unlike The Fifth Season, this novel fails to coalesce the different POVs into a cohesive whole which was one of the best aspects of the first book.
The Obelisk Gate feels like two different stories that were spliced into each other and suffers for it.</description></item><item><title>The Lathe of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</guid><description>spoiler alert Gaslight, Manifest, Philosophize.</description></item><item><title>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-22/</guid><description>Humm&amp;hellip;
It was OK.
Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.
There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of tension as the crew navigates to each planet they&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked with scouring for life. Will they be ok? What will they find? Etc.
But it was hard for me to care.</description></item><item><title>Fugitive Telemetry</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-17/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Network Effect</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-16/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Exit Strategy</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-15/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Rogue Protocol</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-14/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-14/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Artificial Condition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-13/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-13/</guid><description>The Murderbot Diaries series so far have been extremely cyberpunk:
Murderbot hacks its own brain (or part of it) and tells us about it on page 1 of the first novella. People with cybernetic enhancements are so commonplace that Murderbot can (with a little help) disguise itself like one of them and no one bats an eye. From the very start, the story is focused on big corporations having a lot of control and the consequences of that on the workers and slaves (like Murderbot) in the system.</description></item><item><title>Thud!</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/</guid><description>It would be a lot simpler [&amp;hellip;] if this was a story.

It&amp;rsquo;s got a twist.
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyy
I loooooOooOoove twists.
Especially when the foreshadowing of the twist is indistinguishable from terrible writing (absurd internal monologues, nonsensical dialogue between characters) on your first, and probably last, reading of the text.

Minor spoilers below about the basic premise of the series/novel
Children of Memory is the third novel in the Children of Time series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. It follows in the footsteps of the first two books by giving us another story about characters (various uplifted species, human/AI constructs and one fungi species) being thrust together onto another planet.</description></item><item><title>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-21/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-21/</guid><description>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within is a science fiction novel about a diverse cast of characters from all over the galaxy, stuck at an inter-planetary truck stop for an indeterminate span of time, getting to know one another and helping each other overcome (or make peace with) problems in their personal lives.
As the characters learned about each other and gradually opened up about themselves, I started to see parts of myself reflected in them making me feel invested in the mostly low stakes interactions occurring between the characters.</description></item><item><title>A Conjuring of Light</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-18/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-18/</guid><description>spoiler alert It was an enjoyable romp but doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily hit the highs of the previous books in the series. As the third and final(ish) book in the series I was expecting something a little bit more. Or maybe I was expecting a little bit less, a more tightly edited and polished story. Either would have been nice.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some thoughts:
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell a story about an antagonistic character who is basically a god.</description></item><item><title>Cassandra in Reverse</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-17/</guid><description>Everything is too far away and too close at the same time, too loud and also too quiet; a yellow door, an orange can, a blue sliver of sky, a dropped navy glove, the red ring around a street sign; a kaleidoscope turning.

I was skeptical at first (I&amp;rsquo;ve been burned too many times by boring and tropey fantasy novels that so many people love) but V. E. Schwab reeled me in with some gritty and edgy fantasy that felt really &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; to me.

Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage (you can read all of this on the front cover so no spoilers):
In Space Opera, an intergalactic World War 2-standin breaks out, causing much destruction and suffering (while humans remain woefully unaware of this).
As a result of this confrontation, the remaining alien civilizations unite and organize a Eurovision-esque contest (the Metagalactic Grand Prix) to determine how the resources of the galaxy will be shared amongst the participants for the following year (based on their relative ranking in contest).</description></item><item><title>Children of Ruin</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going on an adventure!&amp;rdquo;
If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing out.
Both novels take place in universes that feel very grounded in reality. The way in which the various species present evolve over time, communicate with each other, perceive the world around them and interact with it, feels satisfyingly plausible while simultaneously feeling truly alien.</description></item><item><title>Piranesi</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/</guid><description>I guess this is what happens when a tremendously successful author with a single published novel to her name spends 16 years writing another one.
