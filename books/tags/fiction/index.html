Sam Vimes suffers from a combination of alcoholism and depression leading to his skewed perspective of the world.

Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.
He&rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-05/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=253 height=400 src=/books/2023-10-29/thumbnail_huc29020469e9ebc2846dee4f4d384fb1d_220173_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐▫️▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-29/>Murder on the Orient Express

by
Jose Saramago</a></h2><div>Date read: Fri, Oct 20, 2023</div><div><p>José Saramago refuses to use quotation marks, question marks and exclamation marks in his writing.</p><p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.</p><p>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s wife&rdquo;, the &ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&rdquo;).</p><p>Why does José Saramago do this?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that it makes reading his work harder than it needs to be.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re able to get past the way he writes, or perhaps even enjoy it if you&rsquo;re some kind of sicko, then you&rsquo;ll usually find an interesting story lying underneath with twists and turns that keep you emotionally invested in the world he&rsquo;s built.</p><p>Blindness is by far his most popular work and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. We follow a doctor and his wife during a pandemic of blindness as they, and others affected by the pandemic, are forced into a mental asylum repurposed to contain the newly blind.</p><p>The doctor&rsquo;s wife isn&rsquo;t really blind though (she seems to be immune to this new affliction).

This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.
It&rsquo;s not bad, far from it. It&rsquo;s just inconsistent and a little long.
The setting is cool in theory but in execution I&rsquo;m left feeling as though it&rsquo;s internally inconsistent (and so, less believable than it could be otherwise).<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fantasy/>Science Fantasy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-18/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-14/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=225 height=400 src=/books/2023-10-14/thumbnail_hu67c8a71a94d7cfc0b803a84e92d4e90b_100642_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-14/>The Martian

She has a plan to avenge her sister, burn the system to the ground and build it back up again.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/young-adult/>Young Adult</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-13/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-09/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=219 height=400 src=/books/2023-09-09/thumbnail_hu616c6d22b7571538875676b78d488e14_285237_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐▫️▫️▫️▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-09/>Neverwhere

They&rsquo;re &ldquo;orogenes&rdquo;, people born with the ability to exert control over stone, often, in exchange of their own life force and of the people around them.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fantasy/>Science Fantasy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=261 height=400 src=/books/2023-07-27/thumbnail_hucf069ca392efd8166eaabf7731c43fb5_72611_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/>The Lathe of Heaven

It was OK.
Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.
There&rsquo;s a little bit of tension as the crew navigates to each planet they&rsquo;ve been tasked with scouring for life. Will they be ok? What will they find? Etc.
But it was hard for me to care.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-22/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-20/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=256 height=400 src=/books/2023-07-20/thumbnail_hucfdae5925bc9d085c3ad89deadc441a6_140318_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐▫️▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-20/>Witches Abroad

Murderbot hacks its own brain (or part of it) and tells us about it on page 1 of the first novella. People with cybernetic enhancements are so commonplace that Murderbot can (with a little help) disguise itself like one of them and no one bats an eye.

A sword is pulled out of a stone or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea, and with general rejoicing the world turns.</strong></p><p><strong>But this was real life. The world didn&rsquo;t turn, it just went into a spin.</strong></p><p>Thud! by Terry Pratchett tells the story of Sam Vimes, head of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, and his fellow coppers trying to solve a dwarf&rsquo;s murder. The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.</p><p>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There&rsquo;s ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it&rsquo;s a little grittier and darker than usual.</p><p>Thud! is about prejudice. The main plot as well as every sub plot has something to say about prejudice, how it can cloud our judgement and prevent us from doing the right thing and treating everyone with the respect they deserve.</p><p>The choice to have the protagonist be a prototypical white man in a position of power is great because I would have had a hard time taking the novel seriously if Terry Pratchett, a very white man, had chosen to tell this story from the perspective of a minority.</p><p>Sam Vimes is an honest man doing the best he can but sometimes that&rsquo;s just not good enough. So, for me, throughout the novel, he flip-flopped between being the hero I was rooting for and the antihero I loved to hate.</p><div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fantasy/>Fantasy</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/comic/>Comic</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-12/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-06/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=251 height=400 src=/books/2023-07-06/thumbnail_hu7fc42f401db68b4f50ee0b7056f2ff5a_28714_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-06/>All Systems Red

Although that&rsquo;s mostly true, I don&rsquo;t think this book needs one.</p><p>This is a story about people, it focuses on them and their evolving relationships with one another, finding common ground despite their differences. That&rsquo;s more than enough to keep someone enraptured for however long it takes them to read the book (I know I was).</p><p>But if you&rsquo;re looking for a story about a ragtag group of underdogs overcoming stacked odds to save the universe, you&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something a little bit out there, and are ok with reading something with less action, less sex (although there is some of that) and fewer universe ending apocalypses than you&rsquo;re used to, then I can highly recommend this book.</p><p>Here be spoilers, you&rsquo;ve been warned:</p><div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-21/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-18/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=267 height=400 src=/books/2023-06-18/thumbnail_huceb96a84f33c33d4bda9bd922c51f638_226359_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-18/>A Conjuring of Light

In Space Opera, an intergalactic World War 2-standin breaks out, causing much destruction and suffering (while humans remain woefully unaware of this).
As a result of this confrontation, the remaining alien civilizations unite and organize a Eurovision-esque contest (the Metagalactic Grand Prix) to determine how the resources of the galaxy will be shared amongst the participants for the following year (based on their relative ranking in contest).<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-07/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=260 height=400 src=/books/2023-06-03/thumbnail_hu4149a8142e6873ef19e5ef037b94ab02_233894_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐▫️</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/>Children of Ruin

If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll be missing out.
Both novels take place in universes that feel very grounded in reality. The way in which the various species present evolve over time, communicate with each other, perceive the world around them and interact with it, feels satisfyingly plausible while simultaneously feeling truly alien.<div class="col float-right"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center d-flex-inline-list"><div class=text-center><ul class="list-inline ul-inline"><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/fiction/>Fiction</a></li><li class="list-inline-item li-inline"><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/tags/science-fiction/>Science Fiction</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/><nobr>Check it out →</nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class=col><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=267 height=400 src=/books/2023-05-30/thumbnail_hu8ec2dded45f18cb242515060c36699b7_218772_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></a><h2 class="summary-title text-center">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</h2></div><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-30/>Piranesi
