It&amp;rsquo;s got one of the most unsettling POVs I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while. It starts weird and only gets weirder from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great Halloween read. It&amp;rsquo;s got an Adams Family aesthetic (weird family in a mansion ostracized from their community) but with a less comedic tone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
