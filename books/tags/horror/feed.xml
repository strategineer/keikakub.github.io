I&amp;rsquo;m blown away at how he can integrate all these disparate emotions and ideas into one novel. He did a similar thing for me with Solaris.

I&amp;rsquo;m interested in reading more of his work!</description></item><item><title>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-23/</guid><description>It was strange to be inside myself, walking steadily and rigidly past the fence, putting my feet down strongly but without haste that they might have noticed, to be inside and know that they were looking at me; I was hiding very far inside but I could hear them and see them still from one corner of my eye.
