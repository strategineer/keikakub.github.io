Suffers from being a little bit too predictable for my taste. It&amp;rsquo;s playing with a lot of similar elements as Brom&amp;rsquo;s other work I&amp;rsquo;ve read, &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books/9780061671340">The Child Thief&lt;/a>, things like fairies, the Horned God, but Slewfoot is more successful in execution (&lt;span class="spoiler">
 pun intended
 &lt;/span>) and more nuanced and polished.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under The Dome</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote cite="Stephen%20King%20on%20writing%20Under%20The%20Dome">
 
 &lt;p>I tried to write a book that would keep the pedal consistently to the metal. Nan [King&amp;rsquo;s editor on Under The Dome] understood that, and whenever I weakened, she jammed her foot down on top of mine and yelled (in the margins, as editors are wont to do), &amp;lsquo;Faster, Steve! Faster!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;p class="page-number">Stephen King on writing Under The Dome&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A small American town is trapped under a gigantic forcefield (the Dome), hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Berserk</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781593070205/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781593070205/</guid><description>&lt;p>Berserk is a gritty medieval fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura, who may have been one of the greatest artists ever.

It&amp;rsquo;s got one of the most unsettling POVs I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while. It starts weird and only gets weirder from there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a great Halloween read. It&amp;rsquo;s got an Adams Family aesthetic (weird family in a mansion ostracized from their community) but with a less comedic tone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solaris</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156027601/</guid><description>&lt;p>Fantastic genre-bending sci-fi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mind&amp;rsquo;s eye has never been very good so I rarely latch on to descriptions of the spaces that characters find themselves in. But, the descriptions of Solaris&amp;rsquo;s space station and the planet it&amp;rsquo;s orbiting were so vivid and interesting that it elevated the story for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space station&amp;rsquo;s color scheme of white combined with stripes of vibrant colors lit by the alternating blue and red hues of the system&amp;rsquo;s both suns was breathtaking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
