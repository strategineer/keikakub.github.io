It was OK.
Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.
There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of tension as the crew navigates to each planet they&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked with scouring for life. Will they be ok? What will they find? Etc.
But it was hard for me to care.</description></item></channel></rss>
