Focuses on bringing heroes down to earth while maintaining the wonder and awe of superpowers. Astro City is a reconstruction of the superhero genre instead of a deconstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s a precursor to comics like Invincible and the Boys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Screaming Planet</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594651380/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594651380/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Screaming Planet, Jodorowsky collaborates with artists recommended to him by his publisher on short comics with 10 pages or less very loosely related to a flaming planetary object flying through space. The art styles of each short comic are varied as you can imagine, and some are surprisingly good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No Longer Human</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974707096/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974707096/</guid><description>&lt;p>Junji Ito&amp;rsquo;s art combined with Osamu Dazai&amp;rsquo;s haunting story is a match made in hell.

The extremely taboo and fucked up premise for this is one thing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll read a story about anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just so bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot begin to imagine what sort of circumstances would have led to the production of this comic. That&amp;rsquo;s the story I want to read about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Angel Claws</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650123/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650123/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jodorowsky and Moebius being horny on main and getting into some Freudian hijinks.&lt;/p>

 &lt;p>Whenever he [Moebius] finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spiritual pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.&lt;/p>
