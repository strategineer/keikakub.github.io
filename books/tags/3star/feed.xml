 &lt;p>Whenever he [Moebius] finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spiritual pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mary Gentle&amp;rsquo;s Grunts in a nutshell. Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bear Head</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781800241565/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781800241565/</guid><description>&lt;p>What if you combined Johnny Mnemonic and Total Recall but the data in Johnny&amp;rsquo;s brain is a sentient &amp;ldquo;personality upload&amp;rdquo; of a bio-engineered war bear with 12+ PhDs?

&lt;p>This novel is trying to do a little too much IMO and fails to tell a cohesive story that works all the way through as a result.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A Gathering of Shadows develops the characters introduced in the previous book (along with some fresh faces), portrays the evolution of their relationships with one another and sets everything up for what I&amp;rsquo;m confident is going to be a riveting conclusion to the trilogy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765388889/</guid><description>&lt;p>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Death on the Nile is one of the funniest books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that was the intention of the author almost one hundred years ago when it was first published but reading it now I was chuckling nonstop at how campy and absurd it is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Tombs Of Atuan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459908/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459908/</guid><description>&lt;p>Le Guin mostly successful attempt to write a story in the world of a Wizard of Earthsea told from the perspective of a girl and, eventually, woman.&lt;/p>

More than anything he is committed to creating absurd worlds that feel real. His work has aged beautifully because the world we live in is as absurd as it&amp;rsquo;s ever been and it&amp;rsquo;s only getting more absurd from here on out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small Gods is about an autistic savant (pour a drink every time Terry Pratchett includes an autistic character in one of his Discworld books) named Brutha who is a lowly priest/monk in the church of Om. Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thief Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552148405/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552148405/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few different cooky POV characters doing their own thing, eventually meet up to save big T Time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the characters learned about each other and gradually opened up about themselves, I started to see parts of myself reflected in them making me feel invested in the mostly low stakes interactions occurring between the characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Darker Shade Of Magic</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765376466/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780765376466/</guid><description>&lt;p>I really loved it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was skeptical at first (I&amp;rsquo;ve been burned too many times by boring and tropey fantasy novels that so many people love) but V. E. Schwab reeled me in with some gritty and edgy fantasy that felt really &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was so immersed in the world that I was tearing up by the end of the book which doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen to me very often (one character&amp;rsquo;s arc really spoke to me)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space Opera</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481497497/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481497497/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brave New World</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780307356543/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780307356543/</guid><description>&lt;p>Brave New World is a dystopian novel from 1932 about dystopian shit and it has a lot to say about the dystopia we&amp;rsquo;re currently living in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aesthetic Life And Why It Matters</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780197625798/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780197625798/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all enjoy (and love to comment on) our experiences with media, cuisine, design, games and more.

It seems OK, nothing extraordinary or unique other than the conceit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Think</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780192100245/</guid><description>&lt;p>Think is a book about the big questions in life: knowledge, consciousness, fate, God, truth, goodness, justice. It is for anyone who believes there are big questions out there, but does not know how to approach them. Think sets out to explain what they are and why they are important. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you knew barely anything about philosophy before reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a wild ride.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nine Lives - In Search Of The Sacred In Modern India</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781408800614/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781408800614/</guid><description>&lt;p>British guy goes to India and meets with nine different people, each one on a different religious path and with an interesting story to share.
