The crux of the book is that chronic pain can be a Pavlovian response you&amp;rsquo;ve learned after suffering an injury. When you&amp;rsquo;re desperate, you&amp;rsquo;ll try anything. And, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much harm in applying the simple techniques presented in the book, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did because it seems like it&amp;rsquo;s working.</description></item></channel></rss>
