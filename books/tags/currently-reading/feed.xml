&lt;p>Mary Gentle&amp;rsquo;s Grunts in a nutshell. Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien rippoffs of the 70s and 80s. It also pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story begins with a group of orcs, the Agaku, being tasked with stealing powerful yet non-magical weapons from a dragon&amp;rsquo;s hoard. At the request of the nameless necromancer, Ashnak leads his orcs to the hoard in preparation for the Last Battle between the forces of Light and Dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These weapons turn out to be an impressive array of modern military equipment: assault rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, tanks, helicopters, surface to air missile launchers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You name it, they&amp;rsquo;ve got it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prior to finding these weapons, the Agaku were stereotypical generic fantasy orcs: a little stupid, violent, strong. After finding the military equipment they turn into Korean War-era hurrah, tabbaco chewing, cigar smoking American soldiers (but what if they were orcs fighting against the forces of &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mary Gentle portrays the forces of Light and Dark&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>posits that the weapons we have access to change us (power corrupts), she posits that power is power and war is war,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip; fantasy satire with grit. Think Terry Pratchett but more mature and with a lot more gore and violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>
