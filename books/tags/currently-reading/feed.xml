Le Guin is subverting the old school military science fiction trope of humans going around killing &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; with the humans doing the killing framed as the good guys who we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be rooting for. Maybe colonialism is bad?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
