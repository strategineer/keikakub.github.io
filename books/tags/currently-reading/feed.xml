&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K. Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s seal of approval, I&amp;rsquo;m expecting the rest of it to be just as good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
