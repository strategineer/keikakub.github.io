Pretty enlightening so far, it&amp;rsquo;s even got a description of existentialism that human beings can understand!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kobold Guide to Gamemastering</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936781744/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936781744/</guid><description>&lt;p>A collection of essays about GMing.

Focuses on bringing heroes down to earth while maintaining the wonder and awe of superpowers. Astro City is a reconstruction of the superhero genre instead of a deconstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s a precursor to comics like Invincible and the Boys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ODY-C</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gender-swapped psychedelic sci-fi comic book version of Homer&amp;rsquo;s Odyssey?&lt;/p>
