Pretty enlightening so far, it&amp;rsquo;s even got a description of existentialism that human beings can understand!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kobold Guide to Gamemastering</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936781744/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781936781744/</guid><description>&lt;p>A collection of essays about GMing. Offers some good tips and tricks but it&amp;rsquo;s not as comprehensive or as much of a must-read as &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books/9781645678960">So You Want To Be A Game Master?&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Astro City</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781401232627/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781401232627/</guid><description>&lt;p>Superhero anthology with great art. Focuses on bringing heroes down to earth while maintaining the wonder and awe of superpowers. Astro City is a reconstruction of the superhero genre instead of a deconstruction. It&amp;rsquo;s a precursor to comics like Invincible and the Boys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ODY-C</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781632159274/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gender-swapped psychedelic sci-fi comic book version of Homer&amp;rsquo;s Odyssey?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sounds crazy.

Le Guin is subverting the old school military science fiction trope of humans going around killing &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; with the humans doing the killing framed as the good guys who we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be rooting for. Maybe colonialism is bad?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Under The Dome</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780340992586/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s still got it. Better than ever really. A small American town is trapped under a gigantic forcefield (the Dome), hijinks ensues.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
