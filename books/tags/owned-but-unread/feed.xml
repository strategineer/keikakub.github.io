Le Guin is subverting the old school military science-fiction trope of humans going around killing &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; with the humans doing the killing framed as the good guys who we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be rooting for. Maybe colonialism is bad?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this goes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taoism - The Parting Of The Way</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the book on Daoism that Ursula K. Le Guin recommends in &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09">her rendition of the Tao Te Ching&lt;/a> for anyone who reads the Tao Te Ching and wants to learn more about Daoism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m about a 1/3 of my way through the text. The first Appendix got a good chuckle out of me. The text is pretty much exactly what you might expect and with Ursula K. Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s seal of approval, I&amp;rsquo;m expecting the rest of it to be just as good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Stone Sky</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-10/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Don Quixote</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-09/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-09/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Powers</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-08/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-08/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gifts</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-07/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-07/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Watkins Book Of English Folktales</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-08-04/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Complete Grimm's Fairy Tales</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-29/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-29/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hero With A Thousand Faces</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/1800-07-20/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Unreal And The Real - The Selected Short Stories Of Ursula K.
