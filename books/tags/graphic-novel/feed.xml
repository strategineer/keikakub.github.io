&lt;p>This comic book was first published in 2002 by a Pro-Israel author. Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestenian conflict. So I&amp;rsquo;m expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let&amp;rsquo;s see how far we get.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Berserk</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781593070205/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781593070205/</guid><description>&lt;p>Berserk is a gritty medieval fantasy manga by Kentaro Miura, who may have been one of the greatest artists ever. His art will absolutely floor you time and time again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story of Berserk has its ups and downs, but overall I was left disappointed by it. The story feels like a vehicle that constantly thrusts Guts and his crew into contact with the Eldritch and Demonic horrors that Miura excels at drawing. That&amp;rsquo;s great but it&amp;rsquo;s usually not much more than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of mysteries and ideas are dropped for effect or as cliffhangers and then completely forgotten as the series goes on. This is the curse of long-running serialized manga and it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;ll have to deal with if you want to read Berserk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tomie: Complete Deluxe Edition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421590561/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421590561/</guid><description>&lt;p>Juniji Ito&amp;rsquo;s drawing ability vastly surpasses his writing ability. Reading through Tomie has made that abundantly clear to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cat Who Taught Zen</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780063347618/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780063347618/</guid><description>&lt;p>A cat goes on a journey of self-discovery, teaching and being taught the philosophy of Zen Buddhism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art is great, the text is well written. It&amp;rsquo;s a philosophical picture book for all ages. What&amp;rsquo;s not to like?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yotsuba&amp;!</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316073875/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780316073875/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sandcastle</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781906838386/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781906838386/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sandcastle is the french comic book that the recent M. Night Shyamalan&amp;rsquo;s movie Old was based on. A bunch of different people arrive for a relaxing day at the beach and find themselves aging extremely rapidly, babies become teens and older folk die. Hijinks ensue. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remina</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974717477/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974717477/</guid><description>&lt;p>Junji Ito is cool.
