Joshua Halberstam is the king of strawmanning. Every chapter involves him describing these absurd caricatures of human beings and then using them to try to say to something interesting (keyword: try).
What is presented here is not &amp;ldquo;inspired solutions to real-life dilemmas&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;thoughts and comments on fabricated dilemmas the author came up with&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s not all drivel but there&amp;rsquo;s so much of it that it was hard for me to care about the rest.</description></item></channel></rss>
