&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who to blame for how boring most of this book is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The British for their empire and the consequences of that on the Irish.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Catholics for influencing the Irish and warping their existing folkloric beliefs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lady Wylde herself for presenting these stories in a very blunt and uninteresting way.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of the above?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Secret Of The Golden Flower - A Chinese Book Of Life</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156799805/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156799805/</guid><description>&lt;ol>

Seems like this could have easily been an inspiration for the old school Fallout games I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved. Following one monk through the post-apocalypse is cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 2: Gigantic shift in tone. A less personal, more political story takes hold. Kind of hard to get through. The shift was really jarring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part 3: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten that far yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being And Nothingness</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982105440/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781982105440/</guid><description>&lt;p>Not my cup of tea. Philosophy should be understandable, this text is incomprehensible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe if was downing absinthe with Sartre and his crew back in the forties when this was written, I would &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; it. As-is though, this is pretty hard to get through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everyday Ethics - Inspired Solutions To Real-Life Dilemmas</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780140165586/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780140165586/</guid><description>&lt;p>Joshua Halberstam is the king of strawmanning.
