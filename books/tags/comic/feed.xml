Initially, I was expecting to read stories from adult authors looking back on their childhood, and not kids writing about their current experiences. It&amp;rsquo;s not what I expected but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting so far. I hope these kids got paid.</description></item><item><title>Sandcastles</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2021-07-22/</guid><description>Sandcastles is the french comic book that the recent M. Night Shyamalan&amp;rsquo;s movie Old was based on. A bunch of different people arrive for a relaxing day at the beach and find themselves aging extremely rapidly, babies become teens and older folk die. Hijinks ensue. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description></item></channel></rss>
