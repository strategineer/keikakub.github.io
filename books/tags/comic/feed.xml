Mort takes awhile to get going but once it does it&amp;rsquo;s amazing until the very end. It&amp;rsquo;s Terry Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s combination of philosophical, political, ethical, cosmological ideas infused into (mostly) lighthearted fantasy romps that makes more unique and interesting stories that are still enjoyable to read more than 30 years later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consider Phlebas</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231380/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231380/</guid><description>&lt;p>Iain Banks POV:&lt;/p>

They act like a tight knit four man improv group, bouncing off each other really well and provide a great foundation for the humor, action and hijinks in the novel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doorways In The Sand</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781515444985/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781515444985/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>In fair puzzles there should always be a way out. But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>

 &lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You are a living example of the absurdity of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Witches Abroad</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134651/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552134651/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Thud!</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552152679/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thud! by Terry Pratchett tells the story of Sam Vimes, head of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, and his fellow coppers trying to solve a dwarf&amp;rsquo;s murder. The upcoming anniversary of the thousands years old Battle of Koom Valley is keeping tension high between the dwarves and the trolls; making it harder for the constables of the Watch to keep the peace and solve the crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thud! is a Terry Pratchett novel through and through. There&amp;rsquo;s ample comedy interlaced with impactful action scenes with just a little bit of drama sprinkled in. This time around, it&amp;rsquo;s a little grittier and darker than usual.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Small Gods</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552138901/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552138901/</guid><description>&lt;p>Terry is dedicated to the bit. More than anything he is committed to creating absurd worlds that feel real. His work has aged beautifully because the world we live in is as absurd as it&amp;rsquo;s ever been and it&amp;rsquo;s only getting more absurd from here on out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small Gods is about an autistic savant (pour a drink every time Terry Pratchett includes an autistic character in one of his Discworld books) named Brutha who is a lowly priest/monk in the church of Om. Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thief Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552148405/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552148405/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few different cooky POV characters doing their own thing, eventually meet up to save big T Time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second Terry Pratchett book I read, I preferred Going Postal but this one is no slouch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Going Postal</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552149433/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780552149433/</guid><description>&lt;p>Going Postal is my favorite Terry Pratchett novel.
