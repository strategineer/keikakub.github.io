<a href=#tutorial>¶</a></h1><p>PCs begin play in a small private viewing room, dark unlit, strapped in to their seats watching a series of instructional videos telling them some of what they need to know to succeed at being troubleshooter.</p><strong><p><p>You find yourselves in the Alpha Complex. It&rsquo;s something like Portal&rsquo;s Aperture Science Facility but instead of an underground facility for just doing science, it&rsquo;s supposed to be a completely enclosed ecosystem/world.</p><p>The facility is managed by an all-seeing Computer (The Computer), think Glados but more british.</p><p>You are playing as new troubleshooters, it&rsquo;s your first day on the job. A troubleshooter&rsquo;s role is to deal with any problems that come up in the Alpha Complex. As players, you know that the Alpha Complex is falling apart and in a constant state of disrepair. The Computer is no longer capable of maintaining the facility and it doesn&rsquo;t understand why. The Computer has ratched up the surveillance state and blames everyone but itself for the Alpha Complex&rsquo;s problems.</p><p>Being a troubleshooter is dangerous so each of you have 5 clones in storage who will be deployed if needed. Crimes do not transfer over to your clones, death brings absolution.</p></p></strong><p>Colonel Kernel (old haggard military man, white hair, beret, yellow clearance) enters the room, salutes the group of newly minted troubleshooters, gives the players their iLiveToServe device, gives minimal hints and leaves room for questions.</p><p>Players are given the illusion of choice and presented with three missions through their service device (they can only pick one), players go to R&amp;D department and meet Jefferson, the R&amp;D technician, who assigns everyone on major tool but they aren&rsquo;t allowed to test out their equipmennt before they&rsquo;re in the field. Jefferson will ask them to report back to R&amp;D HQ with their in-field testing results.</p><h1 id=mission>Mission
