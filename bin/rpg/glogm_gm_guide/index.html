<a href=#random-encounters>¶</a></h1><p>source: The Monster Overhaul by Skerples</p><h2 id=theory>Theory
<a href=#theory>¶</a></h2><p>A game consisting entirely of randomly generated
locations, plots, and monsters will feel thin and
meaningless. Random generation can supplement
a GM’s plans, and provide a source of surprise and
wonder, but it cannot entirely replace planning.</p><p>The most boring use of a random encounter is
resource depletion, ritualistically filling time between
planned events. The PCs travel between a safe place
and an interesting destination. The GM rolls a few
dice, consults a table, introduces 1d6 Wolves. The
Wolves attack immediately and fight to the death. The
PCs, unless they make some truly appalling mistakes,
do not risk death or even serious inconvenience. The
only interesting choice is whether to use limited spells
or abilities now, or save them for a later encounter.
If there is no later encounter, the choice is meaningless.
The game, or at least what the players consider the
game, is paused for the duration.</p><p>Alternatively, the GM rolls an Ancient Red Dragon,
who casually vaporizes the party and flies away
without any interaction.</p><h2 id=better-uses>Better Uses
<a href=#better-uses>¶</a></h2><h3 id=time-vs-stealth>Time vs. Stealth
<a href=#time-vs-stealth>¶</a></h3><p>Random encounters can introduce time pressure.
Don’t tarry on the roads, and don’t spend too long
searching this dungeon vault, or the horrible things
gathering in the darkness will spring and devour you.</p><p>Moving cautiously is slower, but gives the PCs a
chance to react to an encounter’s Omen. Moving
quickly means fewer encounters, and more chance
of both sides being surprised, but less control over
what the PCs encounter and how they can react to it.</p><h3 id=information>Information
<a href=#information>¶</a></h3><p>Random encounters can convey details about a
setting that would be instantly forgotten
if presented via a GM monologue. What sort of world
is this? Who lives here? What do they do?</p><h3 id=reframing-current-events>Reframing Current Events
<a href=#reframing-current-events>¶</a></h3><p>A random encounter can provide allies or unexpected
tools to solve other problems. If the PCs encounter
signs of a Medusa, they might return later to bargain
for the Medusa’s aid.</p><p>Players also like to speculate. “Could that Dragon be
the mastermind behind the caravan ambush?”
“Possibly,” says the GM, adding a note.</p><h1 id=tactics>Tactics
<a href=#tactics>¶</a></h1><p>A fair fight is a fight you’ve already lost. Predators
don’t fight fair. Even if the prey knows it is being
hunted, the killing blow tends to be sudden; a
snapped neck, a torn throat, a smashed skull. A long
combat gives an opponent a chance to act.</p><p>Large herbivores, who can afford missing a few meals
and rarely need to sprint, are far more willing to throw
their full weight at a comparatively fragile threat.</p><p>Most conventional creatures won’t attack humans
unless the creature is:</p><ul><li>Very Hungry. Humans are usually too much trouble
to eat. They have sharp parts, fight in groups, and
return to seek revenge.</li><li>Trapped or Startled. If escape doesn’t appear to be
an option, even the most placid creatures may turn
and fight.</li><li>Supremely Confident. From ignorance, experience,
or size, the creature is fairly certain it can eat that
strange pink wobbly thing and get away without
injury.</li><li>Impaired. Anything that affects judgement: rabies,
pain, alcohol, age, etc.</li></ul><h2 id=rivalry-and-display>Rivalry and Display
<a href=#rivalry-and-display>¶</a></h2><p>Intraspecies fights to the death are relatively rare in
nature. The risk of permanent injury and a Pyrrhic
victory is too high. For most species, non-predatory
combat escalates as follows:</p><ul><li>Warning. Calls, marking territory.</li><li>Display. Roaring, posturing, circling. Try to convince
the other side a fight will be dangerously expensive.</li><li>Brief combat. A few swats, a collision, a chase and
counter-chase.</li><li>Focused combat. Until one side retreats.</li></ul><h2 id=social-creatures>Social Creatures
<a href=#social-creatures>¶</a></h2><p>Intelligent creatures with human-like minds can be
convinced to risk death in service of a higher purpose.
While an abstract cause might be enough to assemble
a military force, the only two motivations which
consistently matter in life-or-death situations are
shame and fear; shame of failing fellow combatants
or family (often the same people), and fear of what
might happen if they are not protected.</p><p>Fighting is an excellent way to achieve some goals,
but it is not a universal solution.</p><h2 id=misinterpreted-signals>Misinterpreted Signals
<a href=#misinterpreted-signals>¶</a></h2><p>To a goat, a human stands in a two-legged head-
smashing fight posture, ready for a brawl at any
moment. Cats and owls wiggle their heads to lock
onto prey; stick insects wiggle to imitate a leaf blown
by the wind; humans wiggle for joy. Exposed teeth and
eye contact can be signs of aggression, confusion, or
submission. Intuition may lead to disastrous results.</p><h2 id=the-glory-of-nature>The Glory of Nature
<a href=#the-glory-of-nature>¶</a></h2><p>Visit zoos. Watch unedited wildlife videos. Touch
grass. Stare at the side of a fish. Flip over rocks. Dig
your fingers into the soil. Get a cheap microscope.
Practice describing the texture of the world. Not the
cartoon version, not the silhouette, not the narrative
constructed by a documentary crew.</p><h2 id=the-action-economy>The Action Economy
<a href=#the-action-economy>¶</a></h2><p>A group has a significant advantage over a lone
creature. Each round, the lone creature can do one
thing; its opponents can do many things and can
coordinate their actions. This imbalance in the action
economy can lead to brief and unsatisfying combat.</p><p>Ways to manipulate the action economy include:</p><ul><li>Multiple attacks. Most powerful creatures make two
or more attacks per round.</li><li>Overwhelming deadliness.</li><li>High HP, armour, or damage reduction to make
attacks less effective.</li><li>Movement and positioning. Require enemies to
constantly realign and adjust their plans. Evade
their attacks entirely.</li><li>Interrupt actions. Some creatures can break the
normal turn sequence to attack, or perform actions
in response to attacks.</li><li>Minions. Force enemies to split their attention.</li><li>Additional pressures. A lit fuse. A ritual nearing
completion. Rising water, falling ceilings, spreading
flames, or imperiled hostages.</li><li>Conditional immunity. Cannot be harmed in
darkness, while the obelisks stand, or while the
spellcaster in the background continues to cast.</li></ul><p>GMs should feel free to tweak how some monsters
interact with the action economy.</p><h1 id=monsters>Monsters
<a href=#monsters>¶</a></h1><p>Mythology was not written for RPG purposes.
Creatures have always been created and adapted for
specific reasons, but until very recently those reasons
did not include, “What happens if some imaginary
people in a collective story framework bolted to a
random number generator encounter this monster?”</p><p>The entries in this book try to balance tradition,
interest, utility at the table, and page space.
Mechanically similar creatures are lumped together.
Complex or contradictory tales are distilled to a clear
and immediately accessible set of rules and prompts.
Some monsters are gendered by tradition, but this
can safely be ignored by a GM.</p><p>No bestiary can contain an “authentic” version of a
creature because no such version exists. Elephants
exist; anything humans have to say about elephants
is a pale and distorted reflection of reality, told at a
particular time for a particular reason. The version
created during an RPG session is as authentic and as
meaningful as any other version. Don’t be afraid to
change or invert elements. You are participating in an
ancient tradition.</p><h2 id=the-scale-of-the-world>THE SCALE OF THE WORLD
<a href=#the-scale-of-the-world>¶</a></h2><p>Consider making some monsters unique: a Medusa
vs. the Medusa. This might be it; the only one, the
legendary example, the creature that spawns the
original tale. Or consider generating monsters in
pairs; the monster the players encounter, and their
unseen rival, ally, spouse, or progenitor.</p><p>Common creatures should have an influence on the
local area, and be influenced by it. They should feel
like part of the world. PCs and NPCs should possess
practical knowledge, countermeasures and fragments
of plausible legends.</p><h2 id=names-have-power>NAMES HAVE POWER
<a href=#names-have-power>¶</a></h2><p>When describing creatures, especially unusual or
unnatural ones, consider avoiding the use of familiar
names. An Ogre or a Goblin, laden with other
associations, might be trite or even boring. Describe
glimpses, impressions, and visceral details. One well-
turned phrase can do more to plant an image in the
minds of players than a folio of illustrations. Let their
imagination fill in the gaps. Wonder and terror are two
sides of the same coin.</p><h2 id=types-of-monsters>TYPES OF MONSTERS
<a href=#types-of-monsters>¶</a></h2><dl><dt>Monsters of Warning</dt><dd>Goblins, Lamia, and other night terrors say “Don’t go
out at night, child, or you’ll be eaten.” The Minotaur,
the Ghoul, and other unnatural creatures say “Don’t
break these taboos.” A surprising number of monsters
say “Be polite.”</dd><dt>Monsters of Unease</dt><dd>What does this culture fear? What is it ashamed to
desire? What defect in the world requires correction?</dd><dt>Monsters of Explanation</dt><dd>What are those strange lights in the bog? Why are
trees shredded by the wind? Why do drowned corpses
look like that?</dd><dt>Monsters of Translation</dt><dd>Many classic monsters are victims of enthusiastic
translation. An obscure word in one text becomes
something entirely new in a later collection. Idioms
mutate, figurative expressions become literal, and
adjacent creatures blur together. In keeping with this
tradition, the entries in the Primeval and Strange</dd></dl><p>Water chapters are likely to send paleontologists
howling for their pitchforks.</p><dl><dt>Monsters of Allegory</dt><dd>This temple is protected by a mighty guardian:
the head of the wisest creature (a human), the body
of the strongest creature (bull), and the wings of the
swiftest creature (hawk).</dd><dt>Monsters of Exaggeration</dt><dd>A creature so deadly its venom kills instantly. No,
even its breath can kill. No, merely the sight of it kills.
No, it is so deadly that the sight of it turns its victims
to stone; a superlative form of death.</dd></dl><h1 id=people>People
<a href=#people>¶</a></h1><p><strong>RPG settings should feel complex and inhabited.</strong></p><p>The world is larger than the narrow view of the PCs;
their story is just one among many. Not all encounters
will be relevant, but chance meetings can alter the
course of an entire campaign. The background
bustles. Nothing occurs in isolation.</p><p>People can provide information about the world in
a natural and subtle way. A single vivid detail can
summon more imagery than pages of tedious
background text read aloud by an indifferent GM
to a half-listening group.</p><h1 id=dungeons>Dungeons
<a href=#dungeons>¶</a></h1><p><strong>Dungeons can be extensions of a mythic underworld where the rules of the surface are distorted and the environment itself conspires against intruders.</strong></p><p>Alternatively, dungeons can be practical excavations,
built or amended for comprehensible goals and
inhabited by creatures who find them natural homes.
Who knows what lies buried, forgotten, or imprisoned
beneath the earth?</p><p>A good dungeon should contain (if feasible):</p><ul><li>Multiple paths. Ways to outflank and retreat.</li><li>Notable features or landmarks to aid navigation.</li><li>Enemies and threats.</li><li>Opportunities for diplomacy.</li><li>Traps and penalties for haste and recklessness.</li><li>Something wonderful, unusual, or inexplicable.</li><li>Secrets. Paths and lore. Rewards for curiosity.</li><li>Places where the players can stop exploring and
leave without feeling disappointed.</li><li>An overarching theme, ethos, or purpose.</li><li>Convenient and portable treasure.</li><li>Inconvenient and ludicrously valuable treasure to
tempt players into convoluted schemes.</li></ul></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/bin/rpg/glogm/>◀️GLOGM</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/bin/rpg/glogm_setting/>▶️GLOGM Setting</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
