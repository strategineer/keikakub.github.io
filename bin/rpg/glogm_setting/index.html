<a href=#setting>¶</a></h1><h2 id=core>Core
<a href=#core>¶</a></h2><p>Spells are creatures that can be convinced to join your cause, think Pokémon.</p><p>When you&rsquo;re born, you&rsquo;re bound to a spell semi-permanently (there&rsquo;s always exceptions), called an innate spell, think X Men but with magic.</p><p>More powerful spells are more draining on the caster and can&rsquo;t be used as frequently. Training and experience helps with this.</p><p>Innate spells manifest visually:</p><ul><li>on your body (burning hand, translucent skin, etc.), think Fallout mutations.</li><li>Or as a spiritual aura that surrounds you, think Jo-Jo.</li><li>Or as a familiar that follows you around, think His Dark Materials.</li></ul><p>Your innate spell contributes to your initial position in society. However, innate spells are not 100% known at birth, until the caster casts them the first time, usually in their teens or early adulthood.</p><p>Depending on the society, attempts are made to put people in places where they will be of most utility for the greater good, or profit for the local Baron or slave owner.</p><p>Innate spell-related breeding programs have been attempted in the lands of Korgath, but a solid link between the innate spells of parents and their children&rsquo;s hasn&rsquo;t been found.</p><p>Innate spells can be nurtured, powered up or be changed through various means.</p><p>Innate spells can be stolen, think Heroes, but this is rare.</p><p>Spells can be gained but this requires divine intervention, the use of ancient artifacts or intense studying or journeying to the spell realm where all spells reside.</p><p>Your innate spell may influence your personality, at least that&rsquo;s what people believe.</p><h2 id=places>Places
<a href=#places>¶</a></h2><p>Korgath, an ethno-state ruled by fascists for a long time. Considered to be a threat to all of its neighbours, however tends to keep to itself. Controls a large landmass with abundant natural resources that are exported to neighboring lands.</p><h2 id=creation-myth>Creation Myth
<a href=#creation-myth>¶</a></h2><p>There were four titanic beasts, blood brothers birthed from the womb of Time itself, fought each other to the death. Only one of the brothers remained, known as Angolastra, having received fatal wounds from the battle died.</p><p>Time wept upon his corpse and, in doing so, created the world as we know it today.</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/bin/rpg/glogm/>◀️GLOGM</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
