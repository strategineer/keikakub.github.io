<a href=#core-rules>¶</a></h1><p>Spiked Goblin Punch is based on Arnold K.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goblin Laws of
Gaming&rdquo; homebrew, also known as the GLOG.</p><p>This rules set is designed for old-school D&amp;D-like games. It is broadly compatible with most published Old School Revival (OSR) products (i.e. equally incompatible with all of them). The main goal is to create a system that is:</p><ol><li>Intuitive for new players.</li><li>Adaptable and hackable.</li><li>Compact.</li></ol><p>This PDF assumes you know what an RPG is, what dice are,
and the basics of OSR games, and how to adjudicate rules on
the fly. Rather than a complete system, this hack is designed to
allow experience GMs to run games for experienced players.</p><p>In short, there are bits missing. Read another, much more
complete OSR system, then all in the missing bits.</p><h3 id=gm-guidance>GM Guidance
<a href=#gm-guidance>¶</a></h3><p>Only roll or call for a roll if both success and failure are
interesting. If failure is inevitable because of the �ction, don&rsquo;t roll.
A PC can&rsquo;t test Strength to �ap their arms and �y to the moon. If
failure is boring, don&rsquo;t roll. If the PCs fail to pick a simple
mundane lock, and they have all the time in the world, they&rsquo;ll just
keep rolling until they succeed. Just let them open it or apply a
time penalty. If the PCs not spotting something means they&rsquo;ll
never see it, just tell them what they see. No rolls required.
0
Failed rolls have consequences. The most obvious one is time.
Wasted time means more chances for bad things to happen to
the PCs.</p><p>Roll sparingly. Because stats are randomly generated and
assigned, it&rsquo;s possible two PCs in the same party will have vastly
different chances of performing the same task. Minimize this by
using Attack and Save (which are the same for most Pcs at the
same level), automatic failures, and automatic successes.</p><p>From a player&rsquo;s point of view, a roll is a risk. Testing Strength to
leap across a chasm is risky. Putting a ladder across a chasm
and climbing across is less risky and does not require a roll.
Fighting is a risk. Avoiding the �ght entirely may not require a
roll.</p><h3 id=the-core-mechanic>The Core Mechanic
<a href=#the-core-mechanic>¶</a></h3><p>Almost everything is based on rolling a d20. If you roll equal to or
under a target number, you succeed. Roll over, and you fail.</p><p>Throughout the text, whenever you see “Roll under&mldr;”, it means
“Roll equal to or under&mldr;” It&rsquo;s just a pain to write that out every
single time.</p><h3 id=skills>Skills
<a href=#skills>¶</a></h3><p>Skills are just a word that describes something a PC knows how
to do. There are no speci�c rules for using them. You may call
for rolls under Intelligence or another stat, but in general, just let
the PC with the skill do the thing the skill describes.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Stat</th><th>Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=stats>Stats
<a href=#stats>¶</a></h3><p>Characters have 6 stats. Each stat has a “bonus”, which is a sort
of shorthand condensation of a stat. Don&rsquo;t add the bonus to rolls.</p><dl><dt>Strength</dt><dd>Roll under Strength to open doors, tear apart chains,
or climb a cliff. The number of items a character can carry is
determined by their Strength score. The damage a character
in�icts in melee combat is modi�ed by their Strength bonus.</dd><dt>Dexterity</dt><dd>Roll under Dexterity to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate tasks under pressure. A character&rsquo;s Defense, Movement, and Stealth are modi�ed by
their dexterity bonus.</dd><dt>Constitution</dt><dd>Roll under Constitution to resist cold, disease,
fatigue, drowning, and poison. A character&rsquo;s Hit Points are based
on their Constitution.</dd><dt>Intelligence</dt><dd>Roll under Intelligence to solve dif�cult puzzles,
read obscure texts, or identify items and treasure.
Wisdom: Roll under Wisdom to see through lies, spot hidden
dangers, and avoid mind-altering spells. Characters will also use
Wisdom to determine the order of combat.</dd><dt>Charisma</dt><dd>Roll under Charisma to �atter, beguile, or barter. A
character&rsquo;s Save is modi�ed by their Charisma bonus.</dd></dl><h3 id=associated-numbers>Associated Numbers
<a href=#associated-numbers>¶</a></h3><dl><dt>Attack</dt><dd>Starts at 11. Increases with level. Roll under Attack,
opposed by the enemy&rsquo;s Defense, to hit.
Defense: 10 + Dex. Bonus or bonus from armour. Leather is +2,
Chain is +4, Plate is +6, a shield is +1.</dd><dt>Movement</dt><dd>12 + Dex. Bonus. How fast a character can move.
Penalized by armour (-0 for leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).</dd><dt>Stealth</dt><dd>5 + Dex. Bonus. Applied as a penalty to opponents
Wisdom to see if a character is noticed. Penalized by armour (-0
for leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).</dd><dt>Save</dt><dd>5 + Cha. Bonus. Increases with level. If an effect, attack,
or challenge doesn&rsquo;t fall under any of the other stats or values,
roll Save. This represents a character&rsquo;s luck and determination
to resist the cruel hand of fate.</dd></dl><h3 id=opposed-rolls>Opposed Rolls
<a href=#opposed-rolls>¶</a></h3><p>A character or NPC must roll equal to or under their stat,
modi�ed by 10-[the relevant stat of their opponent].</p><p>E.g. Shoving. The PC has 11 Strength, the orc has 14 Strength.
The PC needs to roll a 7 or less to succeed (11 + [10-14] ).</p><p>Chess. The PC has a Intelligence of 6, the goblin has an
Intelligence of 4. The PC needs to roll a 12 or less to succeed.</p><p>Racing. The PC has a Movement of 12, the gladiator has a
Movement of 14. The PC must roll under 8 to thoroughly beat
the gladiator in a race.</p><h3 id=adjudicating-rolls>Adjudicating Rolls
<a href=#adjudicating-rolls>¶</a></h3><p>A -4 penalty is approximately the same as “reroll and take the
worse of the two results.” A +4 bonus is approximately the same
as “reroll and take the better result.”</p><p>Apply bonuses or penalties to rolls as needed. Go as far as you
need to go, bearing in mind that if you&rsquo;re adding enough
bonuses or penalties rolling may be pointless.</p><h1 id=combat>Combat
<a href=#combat>¶</a></h1><h3 id=combat-1>Combat
<a href=#combat-1>¶</a></h3><p>Switch to combat rounds when it looks like someone might get
hurt.</p><p>If someone (or a group) attacks by surprise, they get to act
before any Initiatives are rolled for the round. Once all
ambushers have acted, everyone rolls for Initiative.</p><h3 id=initiative>Initiative
<a href=#initiative>¶</a></h3><p>Each round of combat, a PC must roll under their Wisdom. If
they succeed, they act before their enemies. If they fail, they act
afterwards. They act in order of their rolls, lowest to highest.
Some particularly quick enemies might impose a penalty on
PCs&rsquo; Wisdom, or act twice in each round.</p><h3 id=on-their-turn>On Their Turn
<a href=#on-their-turn>¶</a></h3><p>A PC or enemy can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Make an Attack roll against a target.</li><li>Run about 50&rsquo;+Movement (or 60&rsquo;).</li><li>Make a charge attack against a target (Move
20&rsquo;+Movement and then make an Attack roll).</li><li>Cast a spell or activate a magic item.</li><li>Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.</li><li>Reload a crossbow, etc.</li><li>Try to trip, shove, or push a target.</li><li>Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a dying ally.</li></ul><p>In addition, a PC or enemy can move 20&rsquo;+Movement (or 30&rsquo;).</p><p>Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and
possibly even in other peoples&rsquo; turns. Basically, you can do one
big thing a turn, plus move a bit.</p><h3 id=attack-rolls>Attack Rolls
<a href=#attack-rolls>¶</a></h3><p>Roll under Attack, opposed by the enemy&rsquo;s Defense, to hit.</p><p>E.g. A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a goblin with no
armour. The Thief has to roll under 11.</p><p>A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a very nimble tiger
(armour as chain). The Thief has to roll under 7 (11+ [10-14] ).</p><p>Other effects (drunkenness, fog, being on �re, etc.) may impose
penalties to Attack.</p><p>Ranged weapons get -1 to Attack for every 10&rsquo; beyond their
listed range.</p><p>Most spells do not require an Attack roll. If a spell does require
one, it will be noted in the spell&rsquo;s description. Touching an
unwilling target always requires an Attack roll.</p><h3 id=critical-successes-and-failures>Critical Successes and Failures
<a href=#critical-successes-and-failures>¶</a></h3><p>On an unmodi�ed Attack roll of 1, the attack deals double
damage (roll twice the number of dice and add any bonuses
twice).</p><p>On an unmodi�ed Attack roll of 20, the attack automatically
misses. Further penalties may apply if the situation is risky. A
critical failure in a one-on-one �ght in a clear meadow might just
be a miss. A critical failure in a tight corridor, with allies and
enemies jostling together, might result in an ally being hit, a
weapon being dropped, or the attacker falling prone.</p><h3 id=damage>Damage
<a href=#damage>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Light weapons (daggers) deal 1d6 + Strength bonus
damage.</li><li>Medium weapons (swords) deal 1d8 + Strength bonus
damage if wielded in one hand or 1d10 + Strength bonus
damage if wielded in both hands.</li><li>Heavy weapons (hammers) deal 1d12 + Strength bonus
damage but must be wielded in both hands.</li><li>Thrown light weapons deal 1d6 damage.</li><li>Bows and Slings deal 1d6 damage.</li><li>Crossbows deal 1d12 damage.</li></ul><h3 id=hit-points>Hit Points
<a href=#hit-points>¶</a></h3><p>The danger a character can resist before taking injury is
quanti�ed by Hit Points (HP). They are better thought of as
“Don&rsquo;t Get Hit” Points. There are no mechanical effects for being
reduced to 0 HP. Any damage in excess of this (i.e. negative HP)
is known as Lethal Damage, which always incurs a roll on the
Death and Dismemberment Table.</p><p>PCs have a maximum HP of 20. Enemies have variable HP
base on their Hit Dice (HD). A hit dice is a d8. Roll the number of
HD listed and add the numbers together. An enemy with
surprisingly low HP might be sickly or wounded. An enemy with
high HP might be a champion (or two enemies).</p><h3 id=healing>Healing
<a href=#healing>¶</a></h3><ol><li>Lunch heals a character for 1d6+Level HP. Lunch takes 1
hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.</li><li>A Good Night&rsquo;s Rest. Restores all HP. Requires 8 hours of
rest, a safe place, a �re or heat source, and consumes 1 ration.</li><li>Magical Healing. Some spells or potions restore HP. Others
can heal Injuries.</li></ol><p>If a character has negative HP (i.e. has taken Lethal Damage),
the next Lunch or Good Night&rsquo;s Rest heals them to 0 and not
over 0.</p><h3 id=weapon-prociency>Weapon Pro�ciency
<a href=#weapon-prociency>¶</a></h3><p>All classes are pro�cient with daggers. A PC is also pro�cient
with any weapons they gain from a class or background. A PC
has -4 to Attack with a weapon until they gain pro�ciency by
landing 8 successful hits in combat.</p><h3 id=reaction--morale-rolls>Reaction & Morale Rolls
<a href=#reaction--morale-rolls>¶</a></h3><p>When encountering monsters, roll 2d6 + the Charisma bonus of
the most visible party member.</p><table><thead><tr><th>2d6+</th><th>Result</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 or less</td><td>Immediate Attack</td><td>Offended or disgusted</td></tr><tr><td>3-7</td><td>Unfavourable</td><td>May attack if victory likely</td></tr><tr><td>8-11</td><td>Favourable</td><td>parley or bargaining</td></tr><tr><td>12 or more</td><td>Very Favourable</td><td>May choose to cooperate.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Monsters (or hirelings) may try to run away or surrender if
combat turns against them. Monsters have a Morale value listed
from 2 (craven) to 12 (unbreakable). Check Morale when:</p><ol><li>The side (PCs or monsters) takes their �rst death.</li><li>When half the side has been incapacitated or killed.</li><li>If some particularly frightening or spectacular effect occurs.
Roll 2d6. If the result is over the creatures&rsquo; Morale score, the
creature attempts to retreat, surrenders, or panics. Morale can
be adjusted (unless 2 or 12) by situational bonuses.</li></ol><h1 id=death--dismemberment-table>Death & Dismemberment Table

Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They
gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for 18 days.</p><p>If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll

<a href=#fatal-wounds>¶</a></h3><p>A PC has 3 rounds to clear all their Fatal Wounds or they die. They can attempt
to remove a Fatal Wound on their turn by rolling 1 on a d6. PCs with Fatal
Wounds are unconscious. This does not mean they are quiet or asleep (they can
be screaming and holding a stump), but it means they cannot take conscious or
deliberate actions. Remove oldest Fatal Wounds �rst. You may want to use
different coloured d6s to represent Fatal Wounds acquired on different rounds.</p><p>Up to two adjacent allies can try to remove Fatal Wounds from a dying character
by spending their turn doctoring the wounded PC and then rolling under ½
Intelligence (unless they have a useful skill).</p><h3 id=injuries>Injuries

to disarm it. No skills. Use common sense and inventory items.</p><p>PCs can quickly move 60 10&rsquo; squares (600&rsquo;) in 10 minutes. PCs
moving incautiously may get a chance to roll under Wisdom to
notice a trap (GM&rsquo;s discretion). Otherwise, they �and traps via HP
and hirelings.</p><p>If you want to modify these movement rates based on
Movement, use 20&rsquo;+the lowest Movement in the group for
cautious movement and 3x that value for rapid movement. In
practice, it rarely seems to matter.</p><h3 id=searching>Searching
<a href=#searching>¶</a></h3><ul><li>A cursory search of a 20&rsquo;x20&rsquo; room takes 1 minute and
reveals only the most obvious information.</li><li>A proper search takes 30 minutes and reveals most hidden
information.</li><li>A detailed search takes 1 hour and reveals all hidden
information.</li><li>Multiple PCs can combine their efforts to search a larger
room in the same time or a smaller room in less time.</li></ul><h3 id=random-encounters>Random Encounters
<a href=#random-encounters>¶</a></h3><p>Roll for a Random Encounter every 30 minutes or whenever a
loud noise occurs. Usually, that&rsquo;s a 1 on a d6. Some people use
an overloaded/hazard dice, where results of 2-6 do anything
from ticking down light sources to providing clues. I don&rsquo;t bother.
Time tracking works just as well.</p><p>If the PCs are moving cautiously, they get the Omen before the
encounter. If they are moving quickly or incautiously, they don&rsquo;t
get the Omen.</p><p>Roll 2d6 for Morale. If the result is equal to or under Morale, the
creature is hostile. If over, positive or uncertain. Modify Morale
by anything from +4 to -4 depending on circumstances.</p><h3 id=light>Light
<a href=#light>¶</a></h3><p>Review the Light rules. Lanterns illuminate 30&rsquo; clearly and
provide dim outlines and shadows for a further 30&rsquo;. In the dark,
light sources are visible miles away.</p><h3 id=other-activities>Other Activities
<a href=#other-activities>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Picking a mundane lock takes 10 minutes.</li><li>Identifying a magic item takes 10 minutes.</li><li>Deciphering an inscription, reading a book, or sorting
through items takes 30 minutes.</li><li>Lunch takes 1 hour. Test for random encounters twice.</li><li>There are about 6 combat rounds in 1 minute. Don&rsquo;t worry
about the exact number of rounds. Just assume combat, a
breather afterwards, and looting take about 10 minutes.</li><li>Eyeball other activities based on real-life experience.
Round up a bit.</li></ul><h2 id=wilderness-procedures>Wilderness Procedures
<a href=#wilderness-procedures>¶</a></h2><p>Hexes are 6 hours across. Not miles, hours. If miles are needed,
the PCs can travel 30 miles a day. Horses don&rsquo;t let the PCs
travel more quickly, but they do make the journey easier.</p><p>Every hex travelled on foot �lls 1 Inventory Slot with Fatigue.
Riding a horse or a cart negates the Fatigue gain unless the
weather is terrible or the road is very rough.</p><p>Hexes contain an obvious feature (something the PCs will
encounter) and a Hidden Feature (something the PCs might
encounter if they search the hex, spend time there, or visit
multiple times).</p><p>Test for a random encounter every 6 hours or whenever the PCs
make a lot of noise or do something that&rsquo;s likely to attract
attention. Usually, that&rsquo;s a 1 on a d6.</p><p>Roll for the weather each day.</p><p>Most activities take 1 hour.</p><p>PCs can safely travel for 12 hours per day (2 hexes), or push
their luck with 18 hours (3 hexes), losing the bene�ts of resting
and having lunch.</p><p>In Civilized Parts, villages and peasants are everywhere. In
wilderness areas, roads may not exist. All land is owned, even
trackless wastes.</p><h1 id=introduction-for-new-players>Introduction for New Players
<a href=#introduction-for-new-players>¶</a></h1><dl><dt>There are elements of chance.</dt><dd>Ever played cops and robbers or any other made-up games?
Did you ever meet the one kid who said &ldquo;Nuh uh, you didn&rsquo;t hit
me, I have a bulletproof vest!&rdquo; In this game of make-believe,
there are a few rules to help decide who hits who, and how hard,
and other things like that.</dd><dt>Your characters are also going to have some random numbers</dt><dt>assigned to them. Sometimes the numbers will be good, and</dt><dt>sometimes they&rsquo;ll be bad, and there&rsquo;s not much you can do</dt><dt>about it. In this game the numbers aren&rsquo;t that important.</dt><dt>Sometimes, a character will terrible stats and survive for ages,</dt><dt>while a character with brilliant stats dies in the �rst hour of game.</dt><dt>There are elements of skill.</dt><dd>In Settlers of Catan, the rules are �xed and solid and balanced.
You can&rsquo;t go &ldquo;Hey Steve, I&rsquo;ll take my Knights and you take your
Knights and we&rsquo;ll go pillage that Sheep tile.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not in the
rules. And that&rsquo;s �ne. But in a game like this, you can come up
with any plans you want to. In that way the game is like a real
world, and the people in it are like real people. Nobody minds
too much if you go around smashing pottery and looting houses
in a video game, but in this game, that sort of thing has real
consequences. Similarly, you can&rsquo;t lure Bowser out of his castle
with a delicious meal in the video game because cooking wasn&rsquo;t
coded into the game.</dd></dl><p>Coming up with a good plan and executing that plan is
important. Be smart. Pay attention. Think of solutions that the
rules don&rsquo;t cover.</p><dl><dt>In Character vs Out of Character</dt><dd>You don&rsquo;t have to do silly voices or wear costumes. You&rsquo;ll �gure
out how comfortable you are acting as your character as we go
along. The main thing, right now, is to remember that your
character knows things you don&rsquo;t know, and that you know
things your character doesn&rsquo;t know.</dd></dl><p>Your character knows things about the world that you, as a
player, don&rsquo;t know. They know how to ride a horse or make
poison or identify magic runes. If there&rsquo;s a situation where that
applies, I&rsquo;ll just tell you what your character knows. If I&rsquo;m not
sure, I might make you roll for it.</p><p>Similarly, there are things you know that your characters don&rsquo;t
know. The main one is reason. We live in a logical age; the
characters you&rsquo;re playing don&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t have the bene�t of a
post-Enlightenment education. They might not even be literate.
You aren&rsquo;t afraid of the weather because you understand what
weather is. Your characters don&rsquo;t. They might not understand
things that we take for granted, and they might act on motives
that we&rsquo;d �ne archaic or ridiculous.</p><p>You, the player, might know things about other characters or the
world that your character doesn&rsquo;t. You might know a secret about
another character&rsquo;s past, or the best way to kill a vampire. But
remember, your character can only act on knowledge they have
in the game.We&rsquo;ll discuss this more as it comes up.</p><dl><dt>Your characters are going to die.</dt><dd>Did you ever play Super Mario Bros? Mario died a lot in that
game. Sometimes he died because you made a mistake.
Sometimes it was chance, or luck, or you were distracted, or you
didn&rsquo;t understand how an enemy worked. This game is like that,
except in the video game, Mario comes back again and again. In
this game, each time you get a new character.</dd></dl><p>Having a character die doesn&rsquo;t mean you made a mistake or
failed. It&rsquo;s part of the learning process. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just
random chance.</p><p>You get to make a new character, and I&rsquo;ll �and a way to introduce
them to the group. You start at Level 1 again but it&rsquo;s not a big
deal. A Level 1 character is just as useful as a Level 4 character
almost every way. You&rsquo;ll never be completely outclassed.</p><dl><dt>Leveling</dt><dd>You level up and improve your character by looting treasure.
Imagine a dragon and its hoard. Kill the dragon and you get 0
XP. Steal the treasure, by force or stealth, and it counts. You
have to get it out of the dungeon and take it somewhere safe,
but once it&rsquo;s safe - buried, spent, invested, or donated - it counts.</dd><dt>The Social Contract</dt><dd>If you like this game and you&rsquo;re having fun, show up on time, or
tell me in advance if you can&rsquo;t make it. If you don&rsquo;t like this game,
let me know and we&rsquo;ll make changes. If anything about this
game makes you uncomfortable, bring it up immediately. If you
don&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that, or it only occurs to you later,
you can always email me.</dd></dl><p>Please don&rsquo;t bring out your phones during game unless there&rsquo;s
something urgent. Ideally this is the most interesting thing going
on. In the same vein, understand that there are 5 other people in
the room, so don&rsquo;t deliberately waste time.</p><p>The setting of this game is semi-medieval. That means that
terrible things happen on a regular basis. It would feel like I was
whitewashing or disney�ng the past if I said that this setting
doesn&rsquo;t include things like misogyny, racism, sexual violence,
etc. These things happen in the real world. It&rsquo;d be strange to
have a �ctional world without them. That being said, they won&rsquo;t
form a major part of this game.</p><p>Gender is also much more important in this game than it is in the
modern world, but possibly less important than you might fear. At
the very high end of society, you can get away with breaking
gender norms by wealth, power, law, and ability. At the very low
end, nobody cares. It&rsquo;s only the middle classes and the Church
who obsess over propriety and station. It probably won&rsquo;t be an
important part of most sessions.</p><dl><dt>The Rules</dt><dd>Are always available for you to read. They aren&rsquo;t secret. If you find inconsistencies or errors, let me know, but the rules aren&rsquo;t
the law. As the GM, what I say goes, and if need be, what I say,
went. If you think you&rsquo;ve found a loophole, but the results of that
loophole don&rsquo;t make any sense, it will stop working immediately.</dd></dl><p>Questions
:: If you have questions, let me know. Some example questions
include:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Can I hit him with an arrow at this distance?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;What does X taste like?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Does my character know anything about X?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;How much damage does a longsword do if I throw it at
someone?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Before we start, do you have any questions right now?</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/bin/rpg/glogm_setting/>▶️GLOGM Setting</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
