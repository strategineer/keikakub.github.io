If you can group up with the first other raider you meet (asking them through emotes AND VOIP from behind cover ideally), you&rsquo;ve just doubled your ability to defend yourself from enemy raiders on this run. Trusting a stranger will build your faith in humanity</dd><dt>Free Loadouts, Free Stress</dt><dd>Free Loadouts are usually a great choice if you&rsquo;re looking to have a low intensity match with lower stakes. But, keep in mind that free loadouts have less inventory slots, including no safe pocket slot, and so if you do find any high value loot during your raid, you&rsquo;re going to be sweating buckets getting it back to your base safely</dd><dt>Free Loadouts, Free Death</dt><dd>Free Loadouts have their perks (they&rsquo;re free), but going into a raid with a single weapon and few useful utility items means that you can easily find yourself at the mercy of better equipped raiders. Hopefully, they&rsquo;re friendly or you&rsquo;re ratty enough to get the drop on them at an appropriate range for the weapon you have</dd><dt>No Fall Damage (If you&rsquo;re smart)</dt><dd>There are many ways of negating fall damage when falling (or jumping off) a cliff or building, here are a few: grabbing on to a ledge before you hit the ground, dodge rolling just before you hit the ground (from up to about 2-3 floors up), grabbing on to a zip line as you fall.</dd><dt>Use your Ears</dt><dd>Gunfire, breaching noise, emotes, proximity chat audio and ARC probes can be heard from surprisingly far away and can usually be used to accurately pinpoint where the sources of these sounds are coming from quite easily. To a lesser degree, looting sounds, footsteps and ARC thruster sounds can also be heard if you&rsquo;re not making too much noise yourself. Use these sounds to navigate through the map safely</dd><dt>Dodge Rolls Will Save Your Life</dt><dd>The Dodge Roll drastically reduces the size of your hitbox and moves your head&rsquo;s hitbox around quickly making it harder for enemy raiders to hit it. Due to almost universally low ammo counts on raider weapons, a well-timed dodge can be the difference between dying and living long enough to take out whoever shooting at you. Dodging into cover is ideal but even dodge rolling in the open can be just as effective especially if you dodge to get closer to cover</dd><dt>One Man&rsquo;s Baron Husk, Another Man&rsquo;s Treasure</dt><dd>Baron Husks are massive dead drones that you find on some maps. If you can hear them emitting a sound, that means that they&rsquo;re full of loot. If there&rsquo;s no one around or you&rsquo;ve got somebody spotting for you, climb on to the top of the Husk, breach the loot cache, once it&rsquo;s open, jump on to one of its legs to avoid the flames then you can go back and loot it. This venting process is very loud and visible on the map so be prepared to encounter raiders soon after</dd><dt>Probes, Probes, Probes</dt><dd>Probes that you can see landing on the planet are absolute gold mines of loot, they are likely to give you high value loot that you can sell or use to build medium shields, among other items</dd><dt>Look at the Timer</dt><dd>When you load into a match look at the Timer in the middle of the screen. If it&rsquo;s around 30min that means you&rsquo;ve spawned into a fresh map, nothing having been looted. If the time is significantly lower, that means that other Raiders have already signed into the map and have been looting</dd></dl></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div></div></div></div><script defer type=text/javascript src=/js/bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
