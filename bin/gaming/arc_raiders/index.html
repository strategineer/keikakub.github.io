<a href=#tips>¶</a></h1><dl><dt>Two Weapons are Better than One</dt><dd>Switching to a secondary <a href=#early-weapon-tier-list>weapon</a> is usually quicker than reloading, so bring two weapons instead of just one. A cheap but effective <a href=#builds>build</a> can be the bolt-action Ferro for drones and long range PvP fights, go for headshots if you can, and the fast-firing Stitcher close range PvP fights is a good start.</dd><dt>Go To Go Fast</dt><dd>Adrenaline shots are really cheap to make so bring them with you on every run, use them to run ASAP to high value loot areas as you spawn into the map, looting them in peace and then extract before anyone&rsquo;s noticed you.</dd><dt>Ape Together Strong</dt><dd>When solo-queue-ing, every other raider you encounter on the map is going to be alone. If you can group up with the first other raider you meet (asking them through emotes AND VOIP from behind cover ideally), you&rsquo;ve just doubled your ability to defend yourself from enemy raiders on this run. Trusting a stranger will build your faith in humanity.</dd><dt>Free Loadouts, Free Stress</dt><dd>Free Loadouts are usually a great choice if you&rsquo;re looking to have a low intensity match with lower stakes. But, keep in mind that free loadouts have less inventory slots, including no safe pocket slot, and so if you do find any high value loot during your raid, you&rsquo;re going to be sweating buckets getting it back to your base safely.</dd><dt>Free Loadouts, Free Death</dt><dd>Free Loadouts have their perks (they&rsquo;re free), but going into a raid with a single weapon and few useful utility items means that you can easily find yourself at the mercy of better equipped raiders. Hopefully, they&rsquo;re friendly or you&rsquo;re ratty enough to get the drop on them at an appropriate range for the weapon you have.</dd><dt>No Fall Damage (If you&rsquo;re smart)</dt><dd>There are many ways of negating fall damage when falling (or jumping off) a cliff or building, here are a few: grabbing on to a ledge before you hit the ground, dodge rolling just before you hit the ground (from up to about 2-3 floors up), grabbing on to a zip line as you fall.</dd><dt>Use your Ears</dt><dd>Gunfire, breaching noise, emotes, proximity chat audio and ARC probes can be heard from surprisingly far away and can usually be used to accurately pinpoint where the sources of these sounds are coming from quite easily. To a lesser degree, looting sounds, footsteps and ARC thruster sounds can also be heard if you&rsquo;re not making too much noise yourself. Use these sounds to navigate through the map safely.</dd><dt>Dodge Rolls Will Save Your Life</dt><dd>The Dodge Roll drastically reduces the size of your hitbox and moves your head&rsquo;s hitbox around quickly making it harder for enemy raiders to hit it. Due to almost universally low ammo counts on raider weapons, a well-timed dodge can be the difference between dying and living long enough to take out whoever shooting at you. Dodging into cover is ideal but even dodge rolling in the open can be just as effective especially if you dodge to get closer to cover.</dd><dt>One Man&rsquo;s Baron Husk, Another Man&rsquo;s Treasure</dt><dd>Baron Husks are massive dead drones that you find on some maps. If you can hear them emitting a sound, that means that they&rsquo;re full of loot. If there&rsquo;s no one around or you&rsquo;ve got somebody spotting for you, climb on to the top of the Husk, breach the loot cache, once it&rsquo;s open, jump on to one of its legs to avoid the flames then you can go back and loot it. This venting process is very loud and visible on the map so be prepared to encounter raiders soon after.</dd><dt>Probes, Probes, Probes</dt><dd>Probes that you can see landing on the planet are absolute gold mines of loot, they are likely to give you high value loot that you can sell or use to build medium shields, among other items.</dd><dt>Look at the Timer</dt><dd>When you load into a match look at the Timer in the middle of the screen. If it&rsquo;s around 30min that means you&rsquo;ve spawned into a fresh map, nothing having been looted. If the time is significantly lower, that means that other Raiders have already signed into the map and have been looting.</dd><dt>Think Twice About Repairing</dt><dd>For some broken items (items with a durability of 0.0), it is cheaper for you to recycle them and then craft them rather than repairing them twice. The most egregious example of this that I&rsquo;ve found so far is the Medium Shield which requires 1x ARC Circuitry and 4x Battery to craft, requires 2x ARC Circuitry and 2x Battery to fully repair (from 0.0 to 100.0) and grants 1x ARC Circuitry when recycled (insert Pepe Silvia meme)&mldr; TLDR, repairing these items only makes sense if you can&rsquo;t craft them yet (crafting a Medium Shield requires Gear Bench II), but even then unless your squad bullies you into it, I would never waste these resources before your inventory is fat with loot.</dd></dl></section><section id=tier-lists><h1>Tier Lists
<a href=#tier-lists>¶</a></h1></section><section id=early-weapon-tier-list><h2>Early Weapon Tier List
<a href=#early-weapon-tier-list>¶</a></h2><p>All the weapons below can be crafted relatively cheaply from the Workbench, except for the Rattler which can be crafted using the Gunsmith I.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tier</th><th></th><th>Name</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=600 src=/img/arc_raiders/weapons/Ferro.webp></td><td>Ferro</td><td>Effective at medium to long range against raiders (especially when they&rsquo;re looting containers so you can headshot them) and at taking out ARC. Extremely cheap to craft.</td><td>Bolt-Action. Slow reloads at level 1.</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=600 src=/img/arc_raiders/weapons/Stitcher.webp></td><td>Stitcher</td><td>High DPS. Effective at short range against raiders and lightly armored ARC. Can be modded with a cheap extended mag, adding 5 bullets to the base of 20.</td><td>High Recoil at level 1.</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=600 src=/img/arc_raiders/weapons/Rattler.webp></td><td>Rattler</td><td>Jack of All Trades. Effective at medium range against everything. Upgrades increase ammo count. Running two Rattlers might be effective, because you can increase your ammo count cheaply and avoid the slow reloads.</td><td>Extremely slow reloads. Low ammo count. Expensive to craft and upgraded (~2-3x the cost of the Stitcher).</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=600 src=/img/arc_raiders/weapons/Kettle.webp></td><td>Kettle</td><td>High ammo count.</td><td>Semi-Automatic. Low bullet velocity. Slow reloads.</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=600 src=/img/arc_raiders/weapons/Hairpin.webp></td><td>Hairpin</td><td></td><td>Tickles raiders and ARC alike. Waste of an inventory slot and crafting materials. Louder than you would expect but I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone else fire a Hairpin so I don&rsquo;t know.</td></tr></tbody></table><dl><dt>TLDR</dt><dd>Running a Ferro and a Stitcher (ideally with a cheap extended mag mod) is extremely cheap and effective. With good aim at short or medium range, you can take out a fully healed raider easily by shooting them with the Ferro once (ideally getting a headshot if you can), sprinting at them while switching to the Stitcher, and finally spraying them with the Stitcher (watch out for the crazy recoil) before they can heal themselves.</dd><dt>Thoughts on the Two Rattler Build</dt><dd>I&rsquo;m not sold on the effectiveness of the two Rattler build just yet because of its high cost. But, you could keep dumping upgrades into the Rattlers so that if you can survive the initial onslaught from another raider (which seems unlikely if they&rsquo;re running two weapons and have decent aim) then you&rsquo;d be able to output more damage over a longer period of time before having to reload. This build might shine in squad play because you and your buddies might be able to take out an enemy squad of raiders leveraging your lack of needed to reload.</dd></dl></section><section id=mid-weapon-tier-list><h2>Mid Weapon Tier List
<a href=#mid-weapon-tier-list>¶</a></h2><p>Until you find some weapon blueprints (which seem to be a very rare loot drop), the weapons above will be the ones you have easy access to. Once you begin upgrading your Gunsmith, you&rsquo;ll get access to the Arpeggio (assault rifle) and the Renegade (battle rifle).</p><p>Early testing with the Arpeggio assault rifle (which can be crafted from the Gunsmith II) is promising but more testing needs to be done to see if it&rsquo;s worth crafting.</p><p>Early testing with the IL TORO shotgun (which can be purchased from the Gun Shop) is promising but more testing need to be done to see if it&rsquo;s worth buying.</p></section><section id=builds><h1>Builds
