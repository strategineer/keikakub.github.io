It can be used effectively anywhere on the map.</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/ladder.png></td><td>Ladder</td><td>You can put it down anywhere and use it to climb anywhere. Using a ladder you can &ldquo;break&rdquo; hard platforming puzzles and make them easy. The ladder extends super far out. The only downside to the ladder is that it takes time to extend and sometimes when you deploy it, it just chooses not to. This is caused by windy maps but it seems to happen randomly at other times.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/rope.png></td><td>Rope</td><td>An all-around good tool. Perfect for saving you from unexpected falls or allowing you to catch your breath after a long climb. You can retract the rope super fast by holding down on the D-pad and extend it by holding up. Interestingly you can climb on the hook itself once it&rsquo;s attached to something. This can come in handy if you&rsquo;re trying to climb on an unclimbable wall. When you&rsquo;re falling and shoot the rope up it seems to maybe just keep going up disregarding gravity? TBD</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/parachute.png></td><td>Parachute</td><td>It&rsquo;ll save you from falling to your death. It activates automatically if you have it selected and you start falling or you can activate it manually like any other item. Switching back and forth between something like the Hook Shot and the Parachute when doing risky maneuvers seems like a good safety trick. The parachute deactivates when you touch the ground. As you can imagine, an activated parachute will make climbing upwards awkward and slow do I don&rsquo;t recommend it if you can avoid it.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/rations.png></td><td>Rations</td><td>An instant stamina boost from 0 to 300% is really good. The only reason it&rsquo;s not S tier is because munching on an energy bar won&rsquo;t save you from falling to your death. Eating also heals permanent stamina damage so I recommend always keeping one on you just in case.</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/teleporter.png></td><td>Teleporter</td><td>It teleports you, it can even teleport you through walls. Not as useful as you might think because the range is short and it&rsquo;s rare for walls to keep you away from a good route. Although I&rsquo;m sure as more uses for the Teleporter are discovered it&rsquo;ll rise to A tier.</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/medkit.png></td><td>Medkit</td><td>Like <strong>Rations</strong> but shittier.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/stake.png></td><td>Stake</td><td>You can shoot this at a unclimbable wall and then use climb with it. Not super useful. Apparently someone threw the spike and it attached to them allowing them to climb anywhere using the spike attached to themselves or something like that. TBD</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/chalk.png></td><td>Chalk</td><td>You can&rsquo;t use this in-game, you have to open the menu to use it. This isn&rsquo;t fast. The climbing chalk doesn&rsquo;t last very long. I haven&rsquo;t found a real use case for this item. Right now it&rsquo;s a waste of an item slot. Using it is as fast as dropping it though so might as well use it if it&rsquo;s in your inventory and you want to get rid of it.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/items/bouncepad.png></td><td>Bouncepad</td><td>Inconsistent and it doesn&rsquo;t do very much on its own. It might be useful for launching yourself into a solid wall and glitching your way up (I don&rsquo;t know if this is possible but maybe?). This is the first item I get rid of if I need to make space in my inventory.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let me know if I missed any consumable items!</p><h1 id=equippable-item-tier-list>Equippable Item Tier List
<a href=#equippable-item-tier-list>¶</a></h1><p>It seems like equippable items that drop from crates are randomly chosen from a set, for example, the high jump effect will be tied to some sort of shoes.

I&rsquo;d have to practice a bunch with this sweater before I would be comfortable using it in a run.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/statuses/protective_helmet.png></td><td>Protective Helmet</td><td>Puffy Jacket - Helmet</td><td>Protects you from damage (fall damage?) somehow. You shouldn&rsquo;t be getting hurt in the first place, and if you do you should have some rations on you or some berries around you to nibble on to get that stamina back. This is a waste of an item slot IMO.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let me know if I missed any equippable items!</p><h1 id=mushrooms>Mushrooms

Touching one of these while having a bit of horizontal momentum seems to multiply it so you can use a Mushroom to go pretty far horizontally. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBXy_IgalCI&amp;t=1073s">this timestamped video</a> for an example of this.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/boost_hoop.png></td><td>Boost Hoop</td><td>Go through at least 3 of these hoops to reliably boost yourself following the trajectory of the hoops. Try not to jump while you&rsquo;re in the air going through hoops, this might kill your momentum.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/crumbling_ice_platform.png></td><td>Crumbling Ice Platform</td><td>Land on these with a bit too much force and they&rsquo;ll crumble.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/frozen_waterfall.png></td><td>Frozen Waterfall</td><td>These can be grabbed onto but if Juan grabs onto the bottom half of this, this half will detach from the rest of it and become a physics object. You can still grab onto this and fling yourself gently as long as you don&rsquo;t hold on.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/geyzer.png></td><td>Geyzer</td><td>These regularly shoot streams of water which can boost you up quite high. If you reach them in between cycles, it might be faster to skip over it and climb normally if possible.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/ground_snow.png></td><td>Ground (Snow)</td><td>This crumbles when you land on it with enough force, be gentle and you won&rsquo;t break it.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/hanging_ladder.png></td><td>Hanging Ladder</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/hanging_log.png></td><td>Hanging Log</td><td>These freely rotate on an axis when weight is placed on either end.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/juan.png></td><td>Juan / Juana</td><td>This is the player character.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/climber_launcher.png></td><td>Launcher (Climber)</td><td>Similar to the <strong>Launcher (Projectile)</strong> but when interacted with, can be climbed into.

If these projectiles hit you with enough velocity (it doesn&rsquo;t take much), you will take permanent stamina damage and lose control temporarily. They can be rotated manually by grabbing onto them but I don&rsquo;t know why you would do that.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/projectile_launcher_rotating.png></td><td>Launcher (Projectile, Rotating)</td><td>Like the <strong>Launcher (Projectile)</strong> but rotates around its axis constantly.</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=lazy class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=300 src=/img/surmount/things/moving_grabby_creature.png></td><td>Moving Grabby Creature</td><td>Similar to the <strong>Whirlwind</strong>.
