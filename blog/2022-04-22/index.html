And to no one&rsquo;s suprise, I guess I&rsquo;m really into escape rooms.
What are escape rooms, you ask?
Borrowing elements from point-and-click adventure games, live-action role-playing, interactive theatre, treasure hunts, movies, and TV shows, an escape room is &ldquo;a live-action team-based game where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually escaping from the room) in a limited amount of time&rdquo;...." property="og:description"><meta content="https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-22/" property="og:url"><meta content="/blog/2022-04-22/thumbnail_hu3d9ca4d674ae835db4bb7c1cbf6d6e97_1199566_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp" property="og:image"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta content="#43B581" data-react-helmet=true name=theme-color><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/bootstrap.min.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href="/apple-touch-icon.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href="/favicon-32x32.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href="/favicon-16x16.png?v=1"><link rel=manifest href="/site.webmanifest?v=1"><link rel=mask-icon href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=1" color=#5bbad5><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?v=1"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#da532c"><meta name=theme-color content="#ff0000"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/site.min.css><title>Strat's Blog</title></head><body id=documentTop><div class=container-fluid><div class="row no-margin justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-12 main no-margin"><nav class=footer-index><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-9 col-12"><div class="container author-blurb"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><a href=https://strategineer.com/><img class="rounded avatar-static float-left" src=/img/fe_portrait.png alt="Strat's Avatar"></a></div><div class="col-md-6 col-auto align-self-center"><div class=row><div class="col-auto text-center">Name's Strat; I'm a rooster illusion and I write about whatever I feel like writing about.

For a brief period of time (usually about an hour or so), you and your friends are physically transported into another world and you&rsquo;re tasked with, well, escaping.</p><p>You and your friends might be handcuffed and placed in two adjacent prison cells, tasked with freeing yourselves and solving a murder.</p><p>You and your friends might be arriving late to a party at a chalet and have to solve a series of Saw-esque puzzles to escape with your life.</p><p>You and your friends might be test subjects trying to survive through a time travel experiment gone wrong.</p><p>Doesn&rsquo;t that sound exciting to you?</p><p>What&rsquo;s genius about escape rooms is that they&rsquo;re grounded in the physical space we live in and in the existing relationships you have with the group of friends you go into the room with.</p><p>Everything else in an escape room is designed to provide you with an interesting shared experience unlike anything you&rsquo;ve experienced in the past.</p><p>Are there bad escape rooms out there? I&rsquo;m sure although I haven&rsquo;t been in one myself.</p><p>Escape rooms aren&rsquo;t all perfect, you might run into a <a href=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle>moon logic puzzle or two</a>. Your gamemaster (the person who&rsquo;s watching your progress and making the experience go smoothly) might not be the best at their job. Any actors involved might not be selling it super well.</p><p>BUT</p><p>A great escape room is going to completely blow you away and give you an experience you&rsquo;ll never forget.</p><p>Next time you want to go out with your friends (or a special someone), instead of going to the movie theater to watch some trash, how about you go to an escape room?</p><p>It might be a little more expensive but trust me it&rsquo;ll be worth it.</p><p>Soon enough, there&rsquo;s going to be an escape room on every street corner and it&rsquo;ll become harder and harder for you to keep avoiding it.</p><p>If you have tried an escape room before and you didn&rsquo;t like it, well&mldr;</p><p>Who hurt you and how can I help?</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Nicholson, S.
