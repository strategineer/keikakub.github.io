This sometimes leads to what&rsquo;s called the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect>overjustification effect</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The overjustification effect occurs when an expected external incentive such as money or prizes decreases a person&rsquo;s intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as motivational &ldquo;crowding out&rdquo;. The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to sustain the activity.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Despite being paid to write code for the past several years now, I&rsquo;m still in love with it.</p><p>Although my relationship to my passion has changed over time. I work full-time as a software engineer and so at the end of the day I&rsquo;m, usually, &ldquo;all coded out&rdquo;.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not always the case though. In the past few months, I&rsquo;ve worked on <a href=https://github.com/strategineer/speedrun-tools-peb>a mod for the criminally underappreciated game Pig Eat Ball</a>, <a href=https://github.com/strategineer/discord-bot>a Discord bot to help some friends and I play the tabletop RPG Everyone Is John</a> and <a href=/blog/2022-01-26/>a little web app to explore and share Marcus Aurelius&rsquo;s Meditations</a>.</p><p>These projects were all small in scope and so I was able to sneak them into my schedule.</p><p>These past few years, I noticed that I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my free time working on creative projects purely for my own enjoyment.</p><p>I write about video games on this blog (worth nothing) and I work on little programming projects for fun (worth nothing to anyone but me).</p><p>I wonder if I&rsquo;m subconsciously going out of my way to work on projects that have no value to anyone but myself because I don&rsquo;t want to be put in a situation where I&rsquo;m paid for any of this.</p><p>If I start getting paid for my creative output, maybe I&rsquo;ll stop having as much fun creating it?</p><p>&ldquo;Wasting&rdquo; my time on creative projects that have no value is a luxury I can afford. My skills as a software engineer are highly sought after and so I&rsquo;m paid well for the work I do during the day.</p><p>I live a life of privilege and I hope I can continue having fun creating unsellable stuff until the day they unceremoniously shove me into the dirt.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Carlson, R.Neil & Heth, C.
