I wasn&rsquo;t brought to an allergy doctor when I was a kid and so I just learned how to deal with it.</p><p>But my symptoms worsened over time, making it impossible for me to ignore them any longer. Eventually, I went to get help.</p><p>How does one treat allergies?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not a doctor but this is what I know.</p><p>Seasonal allergies can be treated through allergen immunotherapy which involves regularly getting injections containing small quantities of the allergens you&rsquo;re allergic too. This helps your body build an immunity to these allergens.</p><p>This process takes 3-5 years and its effectiveness is not 100%. I would really hate myself for going through all that work only for my allergies to come back to haunt me again later on in life.</p><p>No thank you (at least for now).</p><p>You can also buy <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistamine>antihistamines</a> over the counter in Canada without a prescription. They provide temporary symptom relief for some people but they don&rsquo;t do much for me.</p><p>When you&rsquo;ve got allergies as bad as mine you need to use something with a little more kick (but with greater power comes greater side-effects), I use a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid>corticosteroid nasal spray</a> to relieve my symptoms.</p><p>I would rather not have to take medication but I don&rsquo;t really have a choice. I only use the spray during the seasonal periods where I really need it.</p><p>But this year, my <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_dust_mite>dust mite</a> allergies are the worst they&rsquo;ve ever been and I&rsquo;m suffering more than ever before because of them.</p><p>I was recommended to try <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_irrigation>nasal irrigation</a> (also referred to as nasal douching) by a friend to help reduce my symptoms. Hopefully, that&rsquo;ll keep me comfortable until I can get a referral for an allergy doctor from my GP.</p><p>Doctors are a little busier than usual these days. I wonder why?</p><p>Before you start running in the opposite direction, let me tell you that nasal irrigation is legit (this is a meta-analysis study that you can read yourself by going to your nearest <em>science hub</em>).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> You should do an investigation for yourself, always be skeptical!</p><p>It&rsquo;s very simple. You need:</p><ul><li>Sterilised water (distilled or previously boiled then cooled down to avoid letting any brain-eating amoebas into your gooey candy shop).</li><li>Some extra ingredients (we&rsquo;ll get to that later).</li></ul><p>You dissolve the dry ingredients in the water, mixing it well.</p><p>Finally, you douche the solution gently up your nose with a bottle like this. Half of the bottle into each nostril while you&rsquo;re bending over the sink.</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/blog/2022-02-07/bottle_hu5b443a202619e370ae6df436f3dd16ed_2947371_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>That&rsquo;s it. The water goes into one nostril and comes out the other.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a little awkward and it can get a little messy but the symptom relief it provides is surprising.</p><p>My dust mite allergies are at their worst in the winter. For an hour or two after I wake up, my nose is completely blocked and I feel like absolute garbage.</p><p>But, if I douche right after I wake up, it clears out all the mucus and allergens from my nasal cavity and allows me to breathe properly within a few minutes.</p><p>It&rsquo;s amazing&mldr;</p><p>So what are the secret ingredients?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the packaging of the nasal irrigation product I was given as a gift and let&rsquo;s see if we can figure that out.</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/blog/2022-02-07/bag_huaf2fa56047453850e63b81d4ab3a09f1_3619889_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp>
<em>&ldquo;All natural&rdquo;, uhhhhhh I hate this.</em></p><p>If you zoom in real hard, you&rsquo;ll notice the following ingredients: sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate.</p><p>What&rsquo;s that? Sodium chloride is more commonly known as salt, and sodium bicarbonate is also known as baking soda in North America (bicarbonate of soda in the UK and, apparently, Natron in a lot of other European countries).</p><p>These aren&rsquo;t exactly the hardest to find ingredients.</p><p>It seems like using table salt and baking soda straight off the shelf to make my own saline solution &ldquo;should&rdquo; be fine (I will be verifying this with my doctor) despite table salt not being 100% sodium chloride.</p><p><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=/blog/2022-02-07/doctor_hue09e8643baa3940774d83ae140fe40ff_3139149_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box.webp>
<em>A genius who figured out how to sell overpriced salt and baking soda in tiny little packets.</em></p><p>If you&rsquo;ve got serious seasonal allergies like I do then and you&rsquo;ve never nasal douched before, you might want to try it.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Bastier, P.-L.; Lechot, A.; Bordenave, L.; Durand, M.; de Gabory, L.
