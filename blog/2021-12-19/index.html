Here&rsquo;s each book I read this year in the order that I read them.</p><h4 id=understanding-power-by-noam-chomsky>Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky
<a href=#understanding-power-by-noam-chomsky>¶</a></h4><p>Understanding Power is the book that convinced me that I needed to start reading again. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of transcripts taken from Noam Chomsky Q/A sessions, but man, I&rsquo;m glad that I was convinced to sit down and read through it.</p><p>Noam Chomsky has eidetic memory (more commonly known as photographic memory) and so you can ask him about anything and he&rsquo;ll be able to perfectly recall everything he&rsquo;s read and written about the subject. So, even transcripts of his Q/A sessions can be just as informative and important as anything else you&rsquo;ve read in your life.</p><p>The book covers many important topics relating to &ldquo;Power&rdquo; but it mainly focuses on the US, and the many atrocities its leaders have played a part in, across the world.</p><p>Reading this book was difficult. It challenged me to reevaluate many of my preconceived notions about how the world works and I&rsquo;m better for it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also a book that I recommended to many people, and half a year later, not a single person has taken the time to read it&mldr;</p><p>I probably didn&rsquo;t give them a good pitch for it (maybe this isn&rsquo;t a good pitch either?) but in the new year I&rsquo;m looking forward to improving my ability to retain information about the books I read and give better pitches for them!</p><p>If you decide to read one book I mention here, it should probably be this one, but honestly you would probably have more fun reading this next one.</p><h4 id=infrastructure-a-field-guide-to-the-industrial-landscape-by-brian-hayes>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape by Brian Hayes
<a href=#infrastructure-a-field-guide-to-the-industrial-landscape-by-brian-hayes>¶</a></h4><p>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape is exactly what you think it is and it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s a book that covers anything that you could consider to be &ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; (water treatment, electricity, farming, cargo ships, airplanes, mining, etc.) and gives you a broad yet deep understanding of how it all works through clear writing and beautiful photos taken by the author himself.</p><p>After reading Infrastructure, I now have a better understanding of all the infrastructure that surrounds me and this knowledge prevents me from taking anything for granted. I now know what others needed to build (and need to maintain) for me to be able to flip a light switch on and off or pour myself a glass of water.</p><h4 id=on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft-by-stephen-king>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King
<a href=#on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft-by-stephen-king>¶</a></h4><p>On Writing by Stephen King is half part autobiography and half part a guide to writing. You probably know Stephen King&rsquo;s work and you&rsquo;ve probably seen one of the thousands of movie adaptations of his books like It, Carrie or Shawshank Redemption). He is extremely prolific and he&rsquo;s one of my favorite writers so when I heard that he wrote this book on writing, I picked it up right away.</p><p>On Writing does not disappoint. He tells the story of his life and his road to becoming the writer he is today. As you would expect, it&rsquo;s a real page turner. Stephen King could write about paint drying and you would be glued to your seat.</p><p>Eventually, Stephen starts to give advice to people who want to become better writers. He mostly just says to write what you know and to practice every day? To be fair, I&rsquo;ve become a better writer since I started following his advice soooooooooooo he must be onto something.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one passage in particular that has been stuck in my brain for a while now and here it is.</p><p>He says that &ldquo;Writing is telephathy.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Look- here&rsquo;s a table covered with red cloth. On it is a cage the size of a small fish aquarium. In the cage is a white rabbit with a pink nose and pink-rimmed eyes. […] On its back, clearly marked in blue ink, is the numeral 8. […] The most interesting thing here isn&rsquo;t even the carrot-munching rabbit in the cage, but the number on its back. Not a six, not a four, not nineteen-point-five. It&rsquo;s an eight. This is what we&rsquo;re looking at, and we all see it. I didn&rsquo;t tell you. You didn&rsquo;t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours. We&rsquo;re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room… except we are together. We are close. We&rsquo;re having a meeting of the minds. […] We&rsquo;ve engaged in an act of telepathy. No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s something very personal about writing and reading that makes it worth doing. It was nice to be reminded of that.</p><h4 id=the-greek-myths-the-complete-and-definitive-edition-by-robert-graves>The Greek Myths: The Complete and Definitive Edition by Robert Graves
<a href=#the-greek-myths-the-complete-and-definitive-edition-by-robert-graves>¶</a></h4><p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by Greek mythology but my understanding of it came from the sanitized stories I read in D&rsquo;Aulaires Book Of Greek Myths and secondhand from the many modern interpretations of the myths I had seen throughout my life.</p><p>Prior to reading this book, I had never really taken the time to dive deep into Greek mythology.</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad I did because now I cringe thinking about all the times I said that I prefer Greek mythology to Christianity because it&rsquo;s: &ldquo;way funner&rdquo;.</p><p>I mean, in some ways, it is buuuuuuut also Zeus rapes a lot (they don&rsquo;t really talk about that in d&rsquo;Aulaires illustrated book for kids)&mldr;</p><p>If you want to learn about every single Greek myth that exists, then you should read this book. Otherwise, you should stay far far away from it.</p><h4 id=norse-mythology-by-neil-gaiman>Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman
<a href=#norse-mythology-by-neil-gaiman>¶</a></h4><p>Unlike Greek mythology, we don&rsquo;t have many written records describing Norse mythology as it existed. So, there&rsquo;s not really much we know about Norse mythology.</p><p>In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.</p><p>It&rsquo;s OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think I have as much of an appreciation for Norse mythology as he does and reading this book didn&rsquo;t change that.</p><h4 id=the-joy-of-mixology-revised-and-updated-edition-the-consummate-guide-to-the-bartenders-craft-by-gary-regan>The Joy of Mixology, Revised and Updated Edition: The Consummate Guide to the Bartender&rsquo;s Craft by Gary Regan
<a href=#the-joy-of-mixology-revised-and-updated-edition-the-consummate-guide-to-the-bartenders-craft-by-gary-regan>¶</a></h4><p><a href=https://strategineer.com/cocktails/>Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails&mldr; Cocktails, Everybody!</a></p><p>My buddy who&rsquo;s a bartender recommended this to me when I expressed interest in learning how to mix cocktails. It&rsquo;s got a bunch of good cocktail recipes and historical context for most of them (if you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing).</p><p>Interestingly, in the first few pages, Gary describes bartenders as being &ldquo;Ganymedes&rdquo;, a young boy (remember this) who is the immortal cupbearer of Olympus in Greek mythology. This comparison is one you would probably avoid after reading Robert Graves&rsquo;s take on Ganymedes.</p><p>Robert posits that Ganymedes was a character created by the Greeks/Romans much later on and &ldquo;retconned&rdquo; back into the mythology to legitimize their rampant pederasty. Have fun with that information.</p><h4 id=the-odyssey-by-homer-translated-by-emily-wilson>The Odyssey by Homer (translated by Emily Wilson)
<a href=#the-odyssey-by-homer-translated-by-emily-wilson>¶</a></h4><p>I&rsquo;ve never read the Odyssey, and so I chose to read a recent translation of it by Emily Wilson.</p><p>It&rsquo;s written in modern English making it easy to read. There&rsquo;s no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It&rsquo;s a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.</p><p><a href=/blog/2021-12-06/#the-odyssey>I&rsquo;ve shared a few of my thoughts on it here</a>.</p><h4 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?
<a href=#whats-next>¶</a></h4><p>I tried to get into The Eye of the World (the first book of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s popular The Wheel of Time series) but I got about a third of the way through and dropped it. The dread that I feel when reading bullshit fantasy novels seems to be too damn high now.</p><p>No matter how well it&rsquo;s written, I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my time reading a book like this (I wasn&rsquo;t always like this, I&rsquo;ve read all of The Riftwar Cycle by Raymond E. Feist).</p><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with fiction, but if I&rsquo;m going to read fiction I would much rather read something like the Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin which uses a sci-fi world to unpack and explore real world issues.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you absolute nerds.</p><p>Also, I got myself a copy of &ldquo;The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist&rsquo;s Guide To Success In Business And Life&rdquo; on a whim and I&rsquo;ll be starting that before the end of the year. We&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s any good.</p><p>I would like to write at least one book review in 2022 (if it goes well, I&rsquo;ll do more). I was planning on trying that this year but, first, I needed to figure out how to take good notes and retain the important parts of my readings first. I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot better at that sooooooooooooooooooo ya. You can expect at least one book review next year&mldr;</p><p>EDIT 2021-12-20:
I neglected to mention the mangas and comic books that I read this year so let&rsquo;s briefly talk about those for posterity.</p><h4 id=the-drifting-classroom-by-kazuo-umezz>The Drifting Classroom by Kazuo Umezz
<a href=#the-drifting-classroom-by-kazuo-umezz>¶</a></h4><p>Everyone knows about Junji Ito but not many people know about the work of Kazuo Umezz and that&rsquo;s a shame.</p><p>This manga falls into one of my preferred manga sub-genres &ldquo;kids suffering greatly and no one knows why&rdquo; (Bokurano by Mohiro Kitoh is a great one of these). The story takes place in a classroom that&rsquo;s drifting&mldr; If you&rsquo;re a fan of Junji Ito&rsquo;s work like Uzumaki then you should check this one out too.</p><h4 id=remina-by-junji-ito>Remina by Junji Ito
<a href=#remina-by-junji-ito>¶</a></h4><p>Junji Ito is cool. Uzumaki is great. A lot of his other work is just OK. I think Remina is also just OK.</p><h4 id=sandcastles-by-frederik-peeters-and-pierre-oscar-levy>Sandcastles by Frederik Peeters and Pierre Oscar Levy
<a href=#sandcastles-by-frederik-peeters-and-pierre-oscar-levy>¶</a></h4><p>I didn&rsquo;t like Sandcastles. I&rsquo;m not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels. I&rsquo;m either too stupid to understand what it&rsquo;s trying to say or it&rsquo;s not trying to say anything at all. Either way, it didn&rsquo;t make me feel anything&mldr; Maybe I&rsquo;m dead inside?</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action>Follow me with fraidycat, or an RSS reader, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
