      <p>Please don&rsquo;t judge me.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read many books this year but I&rsquo;ve read infinitely more than I did last year.</p>
<p>I used to read during my daily commute&hellip; One day, I just stopped commuting and so I stopped reading too.</p>
<p>This summer, I decided to set aside a bit of time every day to read and here we are. Here&rsquo;s each book I read this year in the order that I read them.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-power-by-noam-chomsky">Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./understanding_power_by_noam_chomsky.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Understanding Power is the book that convinced me that I needed to start reading again. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of transcripts taken from Noam Chomsky Q/A sessions, but man, I&rsquo;m glad that I was convinced to sit down and read through it.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky has eidetic memory (more commonly known as photographic memory) and so you can ask him about anything and he&rsquo;ll be able to perfectly recall everything he&rsquo;s read and written about the subject. So, even transcripts of his Q/A sessions can be just as informative and important as anything else you&rsquo;ve read in your life.</p>
<p>The book covers many important topics relating to &ldquo;Power&rdquo; but it mainly focuses on the US, and the many atrocities its leaders have played a part in, across the world.</p>
<p>Reading this book was difficult. It challenged me to reevaluate many of my preconceived notions about how the world works and I&rsquo;m better for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a book that I recommended to many people, and half a year later, not a single person has taken the time to read it&hellip;</p>
<p>I probably didn&rsquo;t give them a good pitch for it (maybe this isn&rsquo;t a good pitch either?) but in the new year I&rsquo;m looking forward to improving my ability to retain information about the books I read and give better pitches for them!</p>
<p>If you decide to read one book I mention here, it should probably be this one, but honestly you would probably have more fun reading this next one.</p>
<h4 id="infrastructure-a-field-guide-to-the-industrial-landscape-by-brian-hayes">Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape by Brian Hayes</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./infrastructure_by_brian_hayes.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape is exactly what you think it is and it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s a book that covers anything that you could consider to be &ldquo;Infrastructure&rdquo; (water treatment, electricity, farming, cargo ships, airplanes, mining, etc.) and gives you a broad yet deep understanding of how it all works through clear writing and beautiful photos taken by the author himself.</p>
<p>After reading Infrastructure, I now have a better understanding of all the infrastructure that surrounds me and this knowledge prevents me from taking anything for granted. I now know what others needed to build (and need to maintain) for me to be able to flip a light switch on and off or pour myself a glass of water.</p>
<h4 id="on-writing-a-memoir-of-the-craft-by-stephen-king">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./on_writing_by_stephen_king.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>On Writing by Stephen King is half part autobiography and half part a guide to writing. You probably know Stephen King&rsquo;s work and you&rsquo;ve probably seen one of the thousands of movie adaptations of his books like It, Carrie or Shawshank Redemption). He is extremely prolific and he&rsquo;s one of my favorite writers so when I heard that he wrote this book on writing, I picked it up right away.</p>
<p>On Writing does not disappoint. He tells the story of his life and his road to becoming the writer he is today. As you would expect, it&rsquo;s a real page turner. Stephen King could write about paint drying and you would be glued to your seat.</p>
<p>Eventually, Stephen starts to give advice to people who want to become better writers. He mostly just says to write what you know and to practice every day? To be fair, I&rsquo;ve become a better writer since I started following his advice soooooooooooo he must be onto something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one passage in particular that has been stuck in my brain for a while now and here it is.</p>
<p>He says that &ldquo;Writing is telephathy.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Look- here&rsquo;s a table covered with red cloth. On it is a cage the size of a small fish aquarium. In the cage is a white rabbit with a pink nose and pink-rimmed eyes. [‚Ä¶] On its back, clearly marked in blue ink, is the numeral 8. [‚Ä¶] The most interesting thing here isn&rsquo;t even the carrot-munching rabbit in the cage, but the number on its back. Not a six, not a four, not nineteen-point-five. It&rsquo;s an eight. This is what we&rsquo;re looking at, and we all see it. I didn&rsquo;t tell you. You didn&rsquo;t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours. We&rsquo;re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room‚Ä¶ except we are together. We are close. We&rsquo;re having a meeting of the minds. [‚Ä¶] We&rsquo;ve engaged in an act of telepathy. No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very personal about writing and reading that makes it worth doing. It was nice to be reminded of that.</p>
<h4 id="the-greek-myths-the-complete-and-definitive-edition-by-robert-graves">The Greek Myths: The Complete and Definitive Edition by Robert Graves</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./the_greek_myths_by_robert_graves.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by Greek mythology but my understanding of it came from the sanitized stories I read in D&rsquo;Aulaires Book Of Greek Myths and secondhand from the many modern interpretations of the myths I had seen throughout my life.</p>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./d_aulaires_book_of_greek_myths.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Prior to reading this book, I had never really taken the time to dive deep into Greek mythology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I did because now I cringe thinking about all the times I said that I prefer Greek mythology to Christianity because it&rsquo;s: &ldquo;way funner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways, it is buuuuuuut also Zeus rapes a lot (they don&rsquo;t really talk about that in d&rsquo;Aulaires illustrated book for kids)&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to learn about every single Greek myth that exists, then you should read this book. Otherwise, you should stay far far away from it.</p>
<h4 id="norse-mythology-by-neil-gaiman">Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./norse_mythology_by_neil_gaiman.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Unlike Greek mythology, we don&rsquo;t have many written records describing Norse mythology as it existed. So, there&rsquo;s not really much we know about Norse mythology.</p>
<p>In his book titled Norse Mythology, Neil Gaiman riffs on what we know about the Norse myths and creates his own retellings of the stories and some completely new ones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK. I like a lot of Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s work (especially American Gods), his passion for mythology is clear and it shines through most of his work. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t think I have as much of an appreciation for Norse mythology as he does and reading this book didn&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<h4 id="the-joy-of-mixology-revised-and-updated-edition-the-consummate-guide-to-the-bartenders-craft-by-gary-regan">The Joy of Mixology, Revised and Updated Edition: The Consummate Guide to the Bartender&rsquo;s Craft by Gary Regan</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./the_joy_of_mixology_by_gary_regan.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p><a href="https://strategineer.com/cocktails/">Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails, Cocktails&hellip; Cocktails, Everybody!</a></p>
<p>My buddy who&rsquo;s a bartender recommended this to me when I expressed interest in learning how to mix cocktails. It&rsquo;s got a bunch of good cocktail recipes and historical context for most of them (if you&rsquo;re into that kind of thing).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the first few pages, Gary describes bartenders as being &ldquo;Ganymedes&rdquo;, a young boy (remember this) who is the immortal cupbearer of Olympus in Greek mythology. This comparison is one you would probably avoid after reading Robert Graves&rsquo;s take on Ganymedes.</p>
<p>Robert posits that Ganymedes was a character created by the Greeks/Romans much later on and &ldquo;retconned&rdquo; back into the mythology to legitimize their rampant pederasty. Have fun with that information.</p>
<h4 id="the-odyssey-by-homer-translated-by-emily-wilson">The Odyssey by Homer (translated by Emily Wilson)</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./the_odyssey_translated_by_emily_wilson.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read the Odyssey, and so I chose to read a recent translation of it by Emily Wilson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written in modern English making it easy to read. There&rsquo;s no reason to use archaic English, which apparently is the norm with these kinds of texts, when translating a text that was originally in Greek. It&rsquo;s a poem with the same number of lines as the original which is just plain fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting text and now I understand why some people decide to spend their entire lives thinking about it.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2021-12-06/#the-odyssey">I&rsquo;ve shared a few of my thoughts on it here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h4>
<p>I tried to get into The Eye of the World (the first book of Robert Jordan&rsquo;s popular The Wheel of Time series) but I got about a third of the way through and dropped it. The dread that I feel when reading bullshit fantasy novels seems to be too damn high now.</p>
<p>No matter how well it&rsquo;s written, I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my time reading a book like this (I wasn&rsquo;t always like this, I&rsquo;ve read all of The Riftwar Cycle by Raymond E. Feist).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with fiction, but if I&rsquo;m going to read fiction I would much rather read something like the Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin which uses a sci-fi world to unpack and explore real world issues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you absolute nerds.</p>
<p>Also, I got myself a copy of &ldquo;The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist&rsquo;s Guide To Success In Business And Life&rdquo; on a whim and I&rsquo;ll be starting that before the end of the year. We&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s any good.</p>
<p>I would like to write at least one book review in 2022 (if it goes well, I&rsquo;ll do more). I was planning on trying that this year but, first, I needed to figure out how to take good notes and retain the important parts of my readings first. I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot better at that sooooooooooooooooooo ya. You can expect at least one book review next year&hellip;</p>
<p>EDIT 2021-12-20:
I neglected to mention the mangas and comic books that I read this year so let&rsquo;s briefly talk about those for posterity.</p>
<h4 id="the-drifting-classroom-by-kazuo-umezz">The Drifting Classroom by Kazuo Umezz</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./the_drifting_classroom_by_kazuo_umezz.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Everyone knows about Junji Ito but not many people know about the work of Kazuo Umezz and that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>This manga falls into one of my preferred manga sub-genres &ldquo;kids suffering greatly and no one knows why&rdquo; (Bokurano by Mohiro Kitoh is a great one of these). The story takes place in a classroom that&rsquo;s drifting&hellip; If you&rsquo;re a fan of Junji Ito&rsquo;s work like Uzumaki then you should check this one out too.</p>
<h4 id="remina-by-junji-ito">Remina by Junji Ito</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./remina_by_junji_ito.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>Junji Ito is cool. Uzumaki is great. A lot of his other work is just OK. I think Remina is also just OK.</p>
<h4 id="sandcastles-by-frederik-peeters-and-pierre-oscar-levy">Sandcastles by Frederik Peeters and Pierre Oscar Levy</h4>
<p>


<img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid-max-height" src="./sandcastles_by_frederik_peeters_and_pierre_oscar_levy.jpg" alt=""  />

</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like Sandcastles. I&rsquo;m not exactly qualified to critique graphic novels. I&rsquo;m either too stupid to understand what it&rsquo;s trying to say or it&rsquo;s not trying to say anything at all. Either way, it didn&rsquo;t make me feel anything&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;m dead inside?</p>
