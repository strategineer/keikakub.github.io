That&rsquo;s Siralim Ultimate.
It&rsquo;s a game about building teams of creatures to fight other teams of creatures. And that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s the whole thing.
Why is it so compelling?
You choose a specialization (Monk, Cabalist, Necromancer, etc.), each of which gives you access to a certain set of skills to complement your team of creatures.[...]" property="og:description"><meta content="https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-29/" property="og:url"><meta content="/blog/2021-11-29/thumbnail_hu87173657bc2fba27f4cc02974e1a3298_1614292_0x400_resize_q90_h2_box_3.webp" property="og:image"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta content="#43B581" data-react-helmet=true name=theme-color><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/bootstrap.min.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href="/apple-touch-icon.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href="/favicon-32x32.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href="/favicon-16x16.png?v=1"><link rel=manifest href="/site.webmanifest?v=1"><link rel=mask-icon href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=1" color=#5bbad5><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?v=1"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#da532c"><meta name=theme-color content="#ff0000"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/site.min.css><title>blog/ Strategineer</title></head><body id=documentTop><div class=container-fluid><div class="row no-margin justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-12 main no-margin"><nav class=footer-index><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-9 col-12"><div class="container author-blurb"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><a href=https://strategineer.com/><img class="rounded avatar-static float-left" src=/img/fe_portrait.png alt="Strat's Avatar"></a></div><div class="col-md-6 col-auto align-self-center"><div class=row><div class="col-auto text-center">Name's Strat; I'm a rooster illusion and I write about whatever I feel like writing about.
