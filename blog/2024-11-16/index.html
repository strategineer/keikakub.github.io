<a href=#doom-mapping-retrospective>¶</a></h1><p>I&rsquo;ve also been getting back into making Doom maps. In hopes of figuring out how to do that better, I&rsquo;ve played through each of the maps that I made last year and I&rsquo;ve tried to learn from the mistakes I made and come up with a mapping process that&rsquo;ll help me make better maps with less pain and torture involved.</p><p>For posterity, here&rsquo;s all the wads I&rsquo;ve made on my Doom mapping journey thus far with my notes on each of them written below.

I should probably not use DSDA-Doom&rsquo;s rewind feature when playtesting my own maps to playtest for the experience most players will have.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a little too simple to navigate through but at least the routing is clear and foreshadowed (showing off locked doors before the player has the key, showing the player keys before they can get to them).</li><li>Pathing is a little tight at times, every room could have benefited from being at least 25% bigger.</li><li>Mostly cohesive map theming (gameplay + textures).

As a default doors should only be used if necessary and the majority of enemies should be set to ambush, teleported in or revealed from a monster closet.</li><li>Way better placement of weapons, ammo, monsters, etc. in this map compared to the previous ones.</li><li>The Outside room feels unfinished (because it is), there could have been enemies waiting ambush the player as soon as the player exits from one of the two red doors.<ul><li>Although, maybe the intent here was to set up a sort of &ldquo;calm before the storm&rdquo; situation.

<a href=#what-have-i-learned>¶</a></h1><p>Looking through all these maps I&rsquo;ve made (with most of them being incomplete) and thinking about my current struggles getting anywhere with <a href=#thereturn.wad>thereturn.wad</a>, I&rsquo;ve tried to come up with a process for making maps that solves the roadblocks I&rsquo;ve seen myself run into in the past.</p><p>I tried to come up with a process with the following traits:</p><ul><li>A goal-oriented mapping process that allows me to focus on smaller intermediate goals that I can achieve within a reasonable timeframe.</li><li>A process that ensures that I can produce a playable map at any point throughout the process to allow for iterative development and testing. I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck with a pretty but unplayable map at the end of a mapping session.</li><li>A process with natural stopping points which will allow me to step away from a map and allow me to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done&rdquo;, no matter what the current state of the map is. At the minimum, my maps should always be in a state where they can be played from start to finish without any problems. If the process works like I think it should then these maps will never be left in a state where they can&rsquo;t be completed by the player.</li><li>A process with time and spatial constraints to clamp down on the infinite canvas that is a Doom map and prevent this from leading to analysis paralysis. Without mapping constraints, the infinite blank canvas in UDB is a strong demoralizing force for me. No matter how much work I do on a map. I could always spend more time on it, tweaking encounters, rebuilding areas that don&rsquo;t completely work and adding more detail to the environment, forever&mldr; And I&rsquo;ll never get anything done that way.</li></ul></section><section id=the-process><h1>The &ldquo;Process&rdquo;
<a href=#the-process>¶</a></h1><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Do all the prep you can before opening Ultimate Doom Builder. Set a time limit for your session. Set expectations low and constraints high. Always produce a map at the end of each session that can be played to completion. Don&rsquo;t hyperfixate on detailing, if the map is fun then you can make it pretty but not before. That&rsquo;s it, basically.</p><ul><li>Before sitting down at the computer to start mapping, I should come up with the following things:<ul><li>Draw a layout for the entire map by hand on paper or whiteboard.</li><li>The map&rsquo;s theme/premise and a .wad with all the textures I&rsquo;ll be using I&rsquo;ll be using.</li><li>Copy over an existing project directory with doommake scripts ready to go</li></ul></li><li>Set a time limit for the entire mapping process once I&rsquo;ve sat down and opened up Ultimate Doom Builder, by the end of the timer I&rsquo;ll need to have a fully playable and fun map to play, if a little basic, so the following steps keep that in mind:</li><li>Add a spawn point and create an exit switch to ensure that the map is always completeable.</li><li>Create the basic layout of the map in UDB using hand drawn layout from earlier as a guideline (no switches, no doors, no detailing)</li><li>Working mostly on one section of the map at a time:<ul><li>Nail down the scale of the map and make the movement of the player through it fun, leaving space for monsters and other Things to be placed in the next step</li><li>Instrument the map with linedef actions as needed to block/open up progression, open monster closets and teleport monsters in</li><li>Add all the Things to the map: monsters, weapons, ammo, healthkits, keys/skulls</li><li>Make it fun!</li></ul></li><li>When the timer run out, you&rsquo;re done (for now). Move the exit you&rsquo;ve built previously into an appropriate location that&rsquo;s reachable by a player spawning from the spawn point of the map. You&rsquo;ve got a map!</li><li>If what you&rsquo;ve built of the map so far is fun to play and has potential, then you can go to the next step, otherwise you&rsquo;re done, take some screenshots of the map and record yourself playing through it, while commenting on what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work.<ul><li>[OPTIONAL] You can repeat this process from the first step, but this time look at the map as it is, and figure out what you&rsquo;d like to add/change in it to make it better than it is now. If you weren&rsquo;t able to finish up rooms that you drew in your initial layout, you can build those out</li><li>[OPTIONAL] You can continue working on a map forever, so deciding to call a ap</li><li>[OPTIONAL] If your map is ready to share (up to your discretion), share your map wherever you can!<ul><li>Share some enticing screenshots (if you can&rsquo;t come up with any, that might be a problem to solve with your next map).</li><li>Describe the premise of the map and make it interesting if you can, but don&rsquo;t oversell it, be honest.</li><li>Set expectations for the sorts of feedback you&rsquo;re willing/hoping to get.<ul><li>Describing parts of the map that you&rsquo;re particularly curious about might help.</li></ul></li><li>Worst case: you share your map with the world and nothing happens. If the stars align, someone will take the time to play through your map and give you feedback.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s about it for now.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll post here again once I&rsquo;ve got a new map to show.
