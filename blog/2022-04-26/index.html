I&rsquo;m either laughing my ass off watching these comedians try to hold back their own laughter or I&rsquo;m gripping the edge of my seat watching them do anything and everything to get each other to chuckle.</p><p>The game is designed intentionally in such a way that the participants (and the viewers) are constantly switching between states of tension and release which makes for a fun viewing experience.</p><p>The show basically works like this:</p><p>When a smile or laugh is noticed by the host of the show (Hitoshi Matsumoto) through one of the many camera feeds in his control room, he hits his big red button which sounds a buzzer, turns the lighting in the room red and pauses the game.</p><p>Tension rises as the comedians laugh nervously while Matsumoto walks through the door, and lifts a card up to a player (yellow is a warning, and red means you&rsquo;re out) which is followed by a big gong sound.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s what this looks like:</em></p><p><div class="ratio ratio-16x9"><video controls>
