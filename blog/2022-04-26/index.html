I&rsquo;m either laughing my ass off watching these comedians try to hold back their own laughter or I&rsquo;m gripping the edge of my seat watching them do anything and everything to get each other to chuckle.</p><p>The game is designed intentionally in such a way that the participants (and the viewers) are constantly switching between states of tension and release which makes for a fun viewing experience.</p><p>The show basically works like this:</p><p>When a smile or laugh is noticed by the host of the show (Hitoshi Matsumoto) through one of the many camera feeds in his control room, he hits his big red button which sounds a buzzer, turns the lighting in the room red and pauses the game.</p><p>Tension rises as the comedians laugh nervously while Matsumoto walks through the door, and lifts a card up to a player (yellow is a warning, and red means you&rsquo;re out) which is followed by a big gong sound.</p><p><em>If you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s what this looks like:</em></p><p><div class="ratio ratio-16x9"><video controls>
<source src=tldr_documental.mp4>Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.</video></div><em>Say hello to Daisuke and Jimmy, two of my favorite comedians in the show who appear in season 1 and 2.</em></p><p>Tension is released as everyone reviews the tape, discusses what exactly made the person laugh, says their goodbyes if needed and waits for Matsumoto to return to his control room.</p><p>Tension starts to build up again as soon as Matsumoto hits his big blue button, a buzzer sounds, and the comedians go back to trying to make each other laugh.</p><p>This sequence of events repeats, over and over again until 6 hours have past or there&rsquo;s only one comedian left in the room.</p><p>This constant building up and release of tension combined with the &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; mentality of the show makes for a great show.</p><p>Next time you&rsquo;ve sat your ass down in front of your TV about to Netflix and Chill, you should instead Prime and Drill and watch some Documental.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action>None of the artwork or writing on this site was created with the use of AI/LLMs.<hr>If you'd like to get in touch with me, check out my <a href=/about/#contact-info>about page</a>.<hr>Follow me with your <a href=https://fraidyc.at/>RSS reader</a> to be notified whenever I write
