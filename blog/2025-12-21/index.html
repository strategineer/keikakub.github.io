But this change that occurred sometime in the early 2010s forced members of the oldschool roguelike community to find another name for the games that they love that were actually like Rogue.</p><p>The name they landed on was <strong><a href=https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/What_a_roguelike_is>traditional roguelike</a></strong>.</p><p>Hypothetically, if one were to look up <em>traditional roguelike</em> in a hypothetical gamer dictionary, they would find the entry followed by a screenshot of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island.</p><p>As a roguelike fundamentalist, I immediately fell in love with the latest entry in the Shiren the Wanderer series because it&rsquo;s a hyper-condensed embodiment of everything that traditional roguelikes are meant to be while being both welcoming to players new to the genre and providing just as much depth, if not more, than many of its peers.</p><p>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island is a <strong>freak</strong> game because it&rsquo;s designed to be someone&rsquo;s first traditional roguelike and, yet, who in their right mind would decide to get into traditional roguelikes in 2025?</p><p>You tell me.</p><p>If you are a looking to become even <strong>freakier</strong>,</p><div class=spoiler aria-label=Spoiler><p><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/>Caves of Qud</a> might also be a good place to start on your journey to learn to enjoy traditional roguelikes.</p><p>But keep in mind that Shiren and Caves of Qud are <strong>very</strong> different games, so you might like one but hate the other and vice-versa.</p></div></section><section id="Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum"><h2><a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545990/Deadeye_Deepfake_Simulacrum/>Deadeye Deepfake Simulacrum</a>
