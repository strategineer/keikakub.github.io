The &ldquo;dark&rdquo; part of the Dark and Stormy refers to the color but the &ldquo;stormy&rdquo; part refers to the storm of flavors this cocktail creates in your mouth. I&rsquo;ve been told that the key is to buy (or make) high quality ginger beer. I made my Dark and Stormy with Fever Tree ginger beer and it was great.</dd><dt><a href=/cocktails/southside_cocktail/>Southside Cocktail</a></dt><dd>Mint Mint Mint. The liquid infused with mint combined with the mint garnish thrusting into your nose as you sip, make for a wonderful cocktail. Tasting it pushed me to get a pot, some soil and to plant some mint so I can have access to fresh mint all year round.</dd><dt><a href=/cocktails/negroni/>Negroni</a></dt><dd>The words that I would use to describe the Negroni&rsquo;s taste might not be appealing for most people&mldr; Toothpaste? Mouthwash? But I liked it? You might too. The Campari is the ingredient that jumps out at you when you drink this. If you don&rsquo;t like the powerful bitterness of the Campari, then you&rsquo;re not going to enjoy a Negroni.</dd><dt><a href=/cocktails/gimlet/>Gimlet</a></dt><dd>The Gimlet holds a special place in my heart as the first cocktail I mixed. I made my Gimlet using homemade lime cordial (a combination of lime zest, sugar and citric acid). It was good but it wasn&rsquo;t great. I might have gotten too much of the white tarty part of the lime into the cordial leading to a less than ideal cocktail. I&rsquo;ll have to try making it again!</dd><dt><a href=/cocktails/fruity_old_fashioned/>Fruity Old Fashioned</a></dt><dd>There&rsquo;s not much going on with an old fashioned. It&rsquo;s mostly just whiskey with a few additional flavors (and a big ice cube) all of which are needed to make whiskey bearable to drink. Maybe I don&rsquo;t like whiskey?</dd></dl><p>Cocktails are great. I wanted to learn how to mix drinks to become a better host. It wasn&rsquo;t that complicated, it didn&rsquo;t cost me much. It was well worth the effort.</p><p>Very soon, I want to learn how to make homemade ginger beer so that my teetotalers guests don&rsquo;t feel left out. Every week, I&rsquo;m planning to continue my mixology journey by learning how to mix a new cocktail. Wish me luck!</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-06/>◀️Inline images with captions</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-03/>▶️Sleep</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><span class=h4>Recent blog posts</span></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2024-04-02/>What's Up Gamers</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2023-01-02/>GOTY List 2022</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-17/>Avoiding a slow death</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-16/>10 reasons why I'm in love with bouldering</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-22/>Tabletop Roleplaying: Getting your players to care</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 59 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/authors/><button type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's bookshelf sorted by author" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
