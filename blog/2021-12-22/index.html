Keanu&rsquo;s inability to act and William Gibson&rsquo;s inability to write only added to the charm of this movie.</dd><dd>The pile of trash that Johnny stands on when making his speech about wanting &ldquo;room service&rdquo; near the end of the movie represents the movie itself.</dd><dd>I was able to use this pile of trash as a stepping stone to introspect on the disillusionment one can feel as a white-collar worker living in a capitalist dystopia.</dd></dl><p><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=./paddington.jpg alt></p><dl><dt>Paddington</dt><dd>Paddington is a fluffy bear who leaves the forest after tragedy strikes and goes to London to meet the explorer who taught his family to speak.</dd><dd>Far from the place he used to call home, he tries desperately to fit in and surround himself with people who love him.</dd><dd>We are all Paddington and his story is a story of hope that will bring you and your entire family to tears - of sadness but eventually of joy.</dd></dl><p><img class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" src=./bo_burnham_inside.jpg alt></p><dl><dt>Bo Burnham: Inside</dt><dd>A one man comedy-drama musical filmed and recorded in a single room during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After that, the aliens are never mentioned again despite them being critical to the plot.

Her goal is to eventually beat her ex&rsquo;s soccer team and show them that she can be just as good or better than the boys.</dd><dd>If you&rsquo;re nostalgic for Amanda Bynes doing a great job on the big screen, you&rsquo;ve got to watch this.
