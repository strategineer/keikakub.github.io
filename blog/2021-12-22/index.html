write only added to the charm of this movie. : The pile of trash that Johnny
stands on when making his speech about wanting &ldquo;room service&rdquo; near the end of
the movie represents the movie itself. : I was able to use this pile of trash as
a stepping stone to introspect on the disillusionment one can feel as a
white-collar worker living in a capitalist dystopia.</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/paddington_hu242b4cc338d49e709aaf793e28cbc6d0_215500_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><dl><dt>Paddington : Paddington is a fluffy bear who leaves the forest after tragedy</dt><dt>strikes and goes to London to meet the explorer who taught his family to speak.</dt><dd>Far from the place he used to call home, he tries desperately to fit in and

single room during the COVID-19 pandemic. You&rsquo;ll laugh, you might cry, but
you&rsquo;ll probably cry while you&rsquo;re laughing. : Big shoutout to the Jeff Bezos

teachers, drink during the day to keep their blood alcohol percentage at a
certain level for &ldquo;science&rdquo;. : Hilarity and tragedy in equal amounts ensues. :
Another Round might have convinced me to get into mixing cocktails. I&rsquo;m not sure

I&rsquo;m glad to know that it&rsquo;s gradually becoming a cult classic after having bombed
when it first came out. : It was &ldquo;made for girls&rdquo; but no matter who you are,
you&rsquo;re likely to find something to enjoy here (among other things, I enjoyed
watching Megan Fox projectile vomit black gunk all over Amanda Seyfried).</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/mission_impossible_hu7a33f1760900c21c31ec0590e77afb95_284102_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>Mission Impossible : Tom Cruise strikes again, he can do no wrong (on the

ideas I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a movie. : Listening to Tom Holland awkwardly blurt out
thoughts like: &ldquo;Girl, Cute, Lips, Kiss, Girl, Pretty.&rdquo; is perfection. : They
could only afford one scene with an alien. After that, the aliens are never
mentioned again despite them being critical to the plot. I&rsquo;m not sure what
happened there. : I have many questions but my most important one is: how was
this made and why?</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/mandy_hue4c73983c51066793da4444f8dc09b2b_250996_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>Mandy : Produced by our lord and saviour, Elijah Wood, Mandy is a psychedelic
horror movie directed by Panos Cosmatos starring Nicolas Cage. : All of that
sounds good on paper but sounding good is about as far as it goes. : This movie
is the definition of style over substance. After watching it, I would hesitate
to call it a movie, it&rsquo;s more like a series of nonsensical clips stitched
together by a clown on crack. : Smoking copious amounts of the devil&rsquo;s lettuce
might make this movie bearable to watch. : Keyword: might.</p><h2 id=great-coming-of-age-teen-comedy-movies-that-i-watched>Great coming-of-age teen comedy movies that I watched

Twelfth Night. : In She&rsquo;s the Man, Viola&rsquo;s soccer team gets the ax, she asks if
the girls can try out to join the boys team. The coach and her boyfriend (soon
to be ex) laugh at her. : Viola&rsquo;s not happy about this so she &ldquo;becomes the man&rdquo;
and masquerades as her brother Sebastian to play on the boys soccer team at his
high school. Her goal is to eventually beat her ex&rsquo;s soccer team and show them
that she can be just as good or better than the boys. : If you&rsquo;re nostalgic for
Amanda Bynes doing a great job on the big screen, you&rsquo;ve got to watch this. Even
if Amanda Bynes never made your PP go bruh when you were a kid, you should
probably still watch this.</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/clueless_hu30e2f4f7e93356e629de86b0ed757ab8_278519_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><dl><dt>Clueless : Apparently, Clueless is a retelling of Jane Austen&rsquo;s 1815 novel Emma.</dt><dd>A lot of coming-of-age teen comedy films of this era were retellings of
classic stories and Clueless is one of the better ones.</dd></dl><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/debs_huc843ce8af0a7a5703c81fa308121ab0b_272221_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>D.E.B.S. : This is an absurd movie about spies secretly being selected through
the SAT test and a spy-in-training falling in love with a supervillain. : It
bombed at the box office hard, and I mean haaaaaaaaaard. : It&rsquo;s not good but
watching it was life changing.</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/not_another_teen_movie_hu75b570c27373816f594591aa4b946c23_331541_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>Not Another Teen Movie : I love absurd parody movies when they&rsquo;re done well.
This is a great one of those. : If you are a connoisseur of coming-of-age teen
comedies from the 80s and 90s like I am (for some reason) then you&rsquo;ll definitely
get a kick out of this one, otherwise I would skip it.</p><p><img loading=lazy alt class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" width=133 height=200 src=/blog/2021-12-22/blinded_by_the_light_hu4ead6af20896a405cbee9557a634e17c_204053_0x200_resize_q90_h2_box.webp></p><p>Blinded by the Light : Inspired by the life of journalist Sarfraz Manzoor. This
movie, set in the late 80s, tells the coming-of-age story of Javed, a British
Pakistani Muslim teenager whose life is changed after he discovers the music of
Bruce Springsteen. : As someone who has never listened to Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s
music, I was able to discover it alongside Javed over the course of the movie. :
Watching Javed as he tries to follow his dreams of becoming a writer while
navigating the expectations of his family in a brutally racist Thatcherite
Britain is heartwrenching in the best way.</p><p>Annnnnnd that&rsquo;s all folks.</p><p>I also watched a dozen or so other movies (not mentioned here) that made me
wonder if I died in my sleep and was sent to Hell.</p><p>Thankfully, that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet but it&rsquo;s only a matter of time, especially
if I keep watching terrible movies.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action>Follow me with fraidycat, or an RSS reader, to be notified whenever I write
