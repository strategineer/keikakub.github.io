The consumer 3D printing world has gotten a lot cheaper and simpler to get into in recent years.</p><p>In preparation for that I&rsquo;ve been playing around with OpenSCAD. It&rsquo;s a CAD (Computer-aided design) program which, according to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design>Wikipedia</a>, is a computer program used to aid in the creation, modification, analysis or optimization of a design.</p><p>It&rsquo;s 3D modeling but for engineers. Given that I&rsquo;ve been mostly interested building accurate and functional parts and tools for myself this program seemed most appropriate for me.</p><p>What makes OpenSCAD unique is that it is 100% syntax-based. Essentially, you write your 3D object out purely as code and then OpenSCAD generates it.</p><p>But depending on what you&rsquo;re interested in printing, you might be more interested in a different 3D modeling program. If you want to build organic shapes like peolpe, animals, terrain then a sculpting program like SculptGL or ZBrush would be good. If you want to build inorganic shapes like miniature buildings or vehicles then a program like TinkerCAD or Blender might be better suited to your needs. If you want to build real-world copies of people, buildings, objects, anything really then a program like AliceVision, which uses photogrammetry, is best.</p><p>The subreddit r/3Dprinting has a great <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/wiki/gettingstarted>&ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; guide</a> that can help point you in the right direction if you&rsquo;re interested in 3D printing.</p><p>With that said, you can take a look at the 3D models I&rsquo;ve been working on (and their source code) over on GitHub <a href=https://github.com/strategineer/3D-printing>github.com/strategineer/3D-printing)</a>.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><div class="col-auto text-center"><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</div></blockquote></div><nav class="footer d-none d-xl-block"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><a onclick='goToRandomUrl(["https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-10/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-28/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-27/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-26/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-22/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-10/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-07/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-24/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-09/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-02-07/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-23/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-20/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-14/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-12/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-03/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-02/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-12-26/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-12-22/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-12-19/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-29/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-26/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-09-05/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-04-09/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-04-05/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-21/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-15/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-02-04/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-01-18/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-12-31/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-12-27/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-11-15/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-11-07/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-24/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-11/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-04/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-28/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-19/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-13/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-04/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-16/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-06-26/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-01-17/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-08-28/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-12/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-08/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-05-07/","https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-04-24/"])'><button class=menu-icon>
