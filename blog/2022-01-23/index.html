      <p><a href="/blog/2022-01-14/">As discussed in my first entry of my &ldquo;F*** X&rdquo; series of posts</a>, we are motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that encourage us to spend our valuable time on certain activities rather than others.</p>
<p>Companies are not people, they&rsquo;re not your friend. If they could murder you, without getting caught, and sell your organs for profit, they would. Money is what motivates companies to do what they do.</p>
<p>Keep this in mind when you decide to rely on a company to provide you with something you &ldquo;need&rdquo; or really want.</p>
<p>Love has become extremely difficult to come by in the past two years due to COVID shutting down everything (including speed dating events&hellip;).</p>
<p>Dating apps were already ubiquitous but they&rsquo;re now the only effective way for single, and ready to pringle, people to meet each other.</p>
<p>Dating apps are toxic because they&rsquo;re owned by companies who seek to profit from you for as long as possible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not incentivized to have you turn on the app and instantly meet the love of your life. That would be amazing for you! Buuuuuuuut they wouldn&rsquo;t make any money from that.</p>
<p>They need as many active users as possible (this means that they need to offer their ~services~ for ~free~) and they to keep these users in their ecosystem for as long as possible while giving them ample opportunities to spend money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more profitable for dating apps to keep you stuck in a vicious cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>You feel like shit for being alone and not meeting enough people.</li>
<li>The app&rsquo;s algorithm shows you off to enough people and, eventually, someone takes the plunge on meeting you in person.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not impossible but it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;re going to meet someone you click with (there are many people that you might find physically attractive who are unlikely to be suitable long-term partners for you).</li>
<li>You feel like human trash and so there&rsquo;s a small chance that you spend some of your money on the app to encourage the algorithm to show you off to more people (it&rsquo;s a small chance but with enough desperate people using your app, this is a goldmine).</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat from step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You guessed it! This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">Skinner Box</a>.</p>
<p>This is why I hate dating apps.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not built to serve you, they&rsquo;re built to make you suffer. Keeping you hooked with a drip feed of pretty pictures to swipe on and, if you&rsquo;re lucky, some dates and, if you win the lottery, a long-term partner.</p>
<p>If dating apps could build a perfect algorithm that would match you up with someone who is absolutely perfect for you, they would have no incentive to actually use this algorithm.</p>
<p>They would use it to make sure that you&rsquo;re always matched with people you&rsquo;re unlikely to become long-term partners with, increasing the probability that you&rsquo;ll be stuck in the dating app ecosystem for as long as possible.</p>
<p>The game is rigged and the only way to win a rigged game, is to stop playing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing the dating app game and I&rsquo;m much happier for it. But I can&rsquo;t deny that there&rsquo;s few other ways to meet people right now.</p>
<p>Bachelors like me need to make a choice. Do we suffer through the hell that is dating apps in hopes of getting lucky and finding a perfect match? Or, do we decide to not play the game at all and have an even tinier chance of finding someone to love?</p>
<p>For the past two years, I&rsquo;ve decided to not participate in the dating app game and I plan to continue doing that.</p>
<p>But, for how long?</p>
<p>Will I always be satisfied being single?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that I f*cking hate dating apps.</p>
