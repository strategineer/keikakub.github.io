If they could murder you, without getting caught, and sell your organs for profit, they would. Money is what motivates companies to do what they do.</p><p>Keep this in mind when you decide to rely on a company to provide you with something you &ldquo;need&rdquo; or really want.</p><p>Love has become extremely difficult to come by in the past two years due to COVID shutting down everything (including speed dating events&mldr;).</p><p>Dating apps were already ubiquitous but they&rsquo;re now the only effective way for single, and ready to pringle, people to meet each other.</p><p>Dating apps are toxic because they&rsquo;re owned by companies who seek to profit from you for as long as possible.</p><p>They&rsquo;re not incentivized to have you turn on the app and instantly meet the love of your life. That would be amazing for you! Buuuuuuuut they wouldn&rsquo;t make any money from that.</p><p>They need as many active users as possible (this means that they need to offer their ~services~ for ~free~) and they to keep these users in their ecosystem for as long as possible while giving them ample opportunities to spend money.</p><p>It&rsquo;s much more profitable for dating apps to keep you stuck in a vicious cycle:</p><ol><li>You feel like shit for being alone and not meeting enough people.</li><li>The app&rsquo;s algorithm shows you off to enough people and, eventually, someone takes the plunge on meeting you in person.</li><li>It&rsquo;s not impossible but it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;re going to meet someone you click with (there are many people that you might find physically attractive who are unlikely to be suitable long-term partners for you).</li><li>You feel like human trash and so there&rsquo;s a small chance that you spend some of your money on the app to encourage the algorithm to show you off to more people (it&rsquo;s a small chance but with enough desperate people using your app, this is a goldmine).</li><li>Rinse and repeat from step 1.</li></ol><p>Yes.</p><p>You guessed it! This is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber>Skinner Box</a>.</p><p>This is why I hate dating apps.</p><p>They&rsquo;re not built to serve you, they&rsquo;re built to make you suffer. Keeping you hooked with a drip feed of pretty pictures to swipe on and, if you&rsquo;re lucky, some dates and, if you win the lottery, a long-term partner.</p><p>If dating apps could build a perfect algorithm that would match you up with someone who is absolutely perfect for you, they would have no incentive to actually use this algorithm.</p><p>They would use it to make sure that you&rsquo;re always matched with people you&rsquo;re unlikely to become long-term partners with, increasing the probability that you&rsquo;ll be stuck in the dating app ecosystem for as long as possible.</p><p>The game is rigged and the only way to win a rigged game, is to stop playing.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not playing the dating app game and I&rsquo;m much happier for it. But I can&rsquo;t deny that there&rsquo;s few other ways to meet people right now.</p><p>Bachelors like me need to make a choice. Do we suffer through the hell that is dating apps in hopes of getting lucky and finding a perfect match? Or, do we decide to not play the game at all and have an even tinier chance of finding someone to love?</p><p>For the past two years, I&rsquo;ve decided to not participate in the dating app game and I plan to continue doing that.</p><p>But, for how long?</p><p>Will I always be satisfied being single?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that I f*cking hate dating apps.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><div class="col-auto text-center"><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</div></blockquote></div><nav class="footer d-none d-xl-block"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/>‚óÄÔ∏èExploring Marcus Aurelius's Meditations</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-20/>‚ñ∂Ô∏èüëâ üåê: ü§î üå± üìÉ üî†</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent blog posts</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-10/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Vim plugins I like</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-28/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Turbo Kid</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-27/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>My insults to the chef</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-26/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>I'm not laughing, you're laughing...</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Undiscording yourself 101</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 45 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div></div><div class=mobile-only><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto menu-buttons"><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
