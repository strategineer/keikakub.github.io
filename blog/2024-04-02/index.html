I&rsquo;ve been spending all of my writing energy on journaling off and on and writing thoughts on the books I&rsquo;m reading.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not really in the mood to write about too much right now but here&rsquo;s a list of some of the books I&rsquo;ve read in the past year and a half and my thoughts on them.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re not a big reader, you&rsquo;re missing out. Audiobooks are great if you&rsquo;re more into listening to rather than reading a book. If money is an issue, if you look hard enough you can find anything online for cheap and/or free.</p><p>The following books are all fantastic and I would recommend all of them to most people. If you&rsquo;re intrigued by the little blurb I&rsquo;ve written here, click on the link and read some more of my thoughts. Maybe I can convince you to actually pick up and read one of these books.</p><p><a href=/books/2024-02-11/>The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe</a>. A science fiction fantasy novel with a narrator who&rsquo;s trying his best to tell the story of how he came to power. For a series with such an uninspired premise, it is so wild and a must read for anyone interested in complex stories that are begging to be read multiple times over.</p><p><a href=/books/2023-11-13/>Guards! Guards! by Terry Pratchett</a>. Another satirical fantasy novel for people who don&rsquo;t like fantasy novels. All of Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s work is great but this is one of his most popular works for good reason. It&rsquo;s funny as hell.</p><p><a href=/books/2023-10-20/>Blindness by Jose Saramago</a>. Everyone (except the POV character) is going blind, hijinks ensues. Probably the most readable of Jose Saramago&rsquo;s work despite his refusal to name characters or use quotation marks in any of his work. Jose Saramago continuously surprises me with his writing. It&rsquo;s not always great but it&rsquo;s always interesting.</p><p><a href=/books/2023-09-21/>Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins</a>. It&rsquo;s a book for kids about the holocaust, war crimes and depression. I&rsquo;ve read this book twice as an adult and I&rsquo;m expecting to read through the entire series again eventually. I&rsquo;m so impressed by how good this book is, and how much effort was put into making it enjoyable to read no matter how old you are.</p><p><a href=/books/2023-06-17/>Cassandra in Reverse by Holly Smale</a>. A fantastic novel about an autistic character fascinated with Greek Mythology who can control time. The way autism is portrayed generally in media is awful, reading an amazing book with a true to life portrayal of autism was such a pleasure.</p><p>So ya, that&rsquo;s about it. You can expect me to continue to share more of my thoughts on the books I read.</p><p>If you read anything I recommend or have anything to recommend me, let me know! I&rsquo;m always looking forward to talk about books with people.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2023-01-02/>▶️GOTY List 2022</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><span class=h4>Recent blog posts</span></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2023-01-02/>GOTY List 2022</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-17/>Avoiding a slow death</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-16/>10 reasons why I'm in love with bouldering</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-22/>Tabletop Roleplaying: Getting your players to care</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-17/>On Being Awesome (1)</a></li><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 58 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="Navigation buttons"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/authors/><button type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's bookshelf sorted by author" class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
