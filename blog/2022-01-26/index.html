<a href=#get-a-digital-version-of-the-meditations>¶</a></h2><p>First, I needed to acquire a digital version of the text (I try to read physical books these days because writing notes in them is critical for me to retain the information I&rsquo;m reading).</p><p>I used my expert Googler skills to find a PDF file of Gregory Hays&rsquo;s translation of the text which I read.</p><p>Then, I used the aptly named <code>pdftotext</code> command line utility to take the PDF file and extract the text from it.</p><h2 id=clean-up-the-digital-version-of-the-meditations>Clean up the digital version of the Meditations
<a href=#clean-up-the-digital-version-of-the-meditations>¶</a></h2><p>Now, I needed to find and separate each meditation in the text while also removing all of the extra line breaks which have been retained through the <code>pdftotext</code> process.</p><p>Technically, I could have done this by hand (which would have taken days of work and would leave room for error) but why would I do that when I can make the computer work for me.</p><p>I wrote a <a href=https://github.com/strategineer/personal-website/blob/master/bin/get_meditations.py>python script to do the hard work for me</a>.</p><p>How?</p><p>Using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>Regular Expressions</a>, of course.</p><p>No matter what kind of programming you expect to do or enjoy doing, knowing how to use regular expressions (regex) to sift through text is an invaluable skill.</p><p>Lucky for us, the text of the Meditations has a very regular structure.</p><p>The word &ldquo;Book&rdquo; followed by a space and number from 1 to 12 separates each of the books within the text.</p><p>So, I wrote the following regex to separate the entire text into 12 chunks, one for each book.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>BOOK_REGEX <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> re<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>compile(<span style=color:#e6db74>r</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Book [0-9]+&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>This simple regex should be read as &ldquo;find the word &lsquo;Book&rsquo;, followed by a space, followed by one or more digits&rdquo;.</em></p><p>Each meditation within each book is preceded by a number followed by a dot.</p><p>So, I wrote the following regex to separate each book into each of its meditations.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>POINT_REGEX <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> re<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>compile(<span style=color:#e6db74>r</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;[0-9]+\.&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>This simple regex should be read as &ldquo;find one or more digits followed by a dot&rdquo;. The &lsquo;.&rsquo; is a special regex character which refers to any character (it&rsquo;s a wildcard) so we must &rsquo;escape&rsquo; its special meaning using a backslash.</em></p><p>The text we&rsquo;ve extracted from the PDF file has a ton of extra line breaks everywhere which we don&rsquo;t want because we&rsquo;re not planning on displaying the text in a fixed print format. The line breaks will be added as needed depending on whether you&rsquo;re using a tiny phone or a gigantic computer screen to use this tool.</p><p>So, I wrote the following regex to find and remove all of these line breaks.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>ARTIFICIAL_LINE_BREAK_REGEX <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> re<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>compile(<span style=color:#e6db74>r</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;([a-zA-Z\-,\(\) ])\n+([a-zA-Z ])&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><em>This less simple regex should be read as &ldquo;find a letter, dash, comma, left parentheses, right parentheses or space followed by a newline followed a letter or space&rdquo;. Notice that we&rsquo;ve put everything to the left of the newline in parentheses as well as everything to the right of the newline. These are called &ldquo;groups&rdquo; and are useful to separate the different parts of a regex. In this case, we use groups to detect the offending newlines (which we want to remove) separate from there surrounding characters (which we don&rsquo;t want to remove).</em></p><p>We&rsquo;ve separated each book into each of its meditations in order, and so now the script can print this data out in a JSON format which we can easily read and use elsewhere.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>python3 get_meditations.py &gt; data/meditations.json

This allows you to browse through meditations that cover similar topics which makes it easier for you to discover the nuances and, sometimes, contradictions in them.</p><p>All throughout this process, I played around with the look and feel of the tool using my decent knowlege of CSS and <a href=https://getbootstrap.com/>Bootstrap</a> (which I&rsquo;ve been cultivating my entire career).</p><p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p><h2 id=the-end>The End.
