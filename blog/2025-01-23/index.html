<a href=#concise-efficient-rules>¶</a></h3><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about Shadowdark, but its defining feature is that it&rsquo;s surprisingly <strong>elegant</strong> (considering that it won the <a href=https://ennie-awards.com/portfolio-item/2024-nominees-and-winners/>Ennie Award for Best Game in 2024</a>, this shouldn&rsquo;t come as too much of a surprise).</p><p>The rulebook is a masterpiece of design&ndash;it&rsquo;s one of the best-laid-out rulebooks I&rsquo;ve read. The rules are concise, clear, and comprehensive enough to allow new and experienced GMs to run fun Shadowdark games right away.</p></section><section id=a-great-osr-system-for-less-experienced-gms><h3>A great OSR system for less experienced GMs
<a href=#a-great-osr-system-for-less-experienced-gms>¶</a></h3><p>The Shadowdark RPG rulebook is incredibly helpful for GMs. It doesn&rsquo;t assume years of experience and provides clear instructions on how to run the game.</p><p>For example, how do you, as the GM, emphasize the danger and urgency of exploring a dark, dank dungeon? Many OSR systems assume you already know how to do this.</p><p>Shadowdark RPG rules go out of their way to give GMs&ndash;who&rsquo;ve never run an OSR game like this before&ndash;guidance on exactly how to do it.</p><p>Shadowdark&rsquo;s masterstroke is that 10 minutes of real time represents 10 minutes of game time. And, depending on how dangerous the area the PCs are in, every so often you&rsquo;ll roll a d6 to check for a random encounter. On a roll of 1, the PCs encounter something or someone.</p><p>This makes it clear that spending real time discussing next steps or in-game time searching under every tile in a room for traps increases the risk of a random encounter.</p><p>The system encourages players to just <strong>do</strong> something, which tends to be more fun and helps keep the game from becoming a slog.</p><p>While experienced GMs can solve these problems intuitively, Shadowdark RPG provides explicit guidance; which is incredibly helpful for new GMs. This ethos makes Shadowdark RPG stand out among its many OSR peers.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how amazingly concise and useful the rulebook is. Still, it won&rsquo;t be a perfect fit for every OSR campaign you&rsquo;re going to run.</p></section><section id=whats-less-cool-about-shadowdark-rpg><h2>What&rsquo;s less cool about Shadowdark RPG?
<a href=#whats-less-cool-about-shadowdark-rpg>¶</a></h2></section><section id=supplemental-classes-are-inconsistent><h3>Supplemental classes are inconsistent
<a href=#supplemental-classes-are-inconsistent>¶</a></h3><p>Some of the classes found in the Shadowdark official zines feel out of place, too strong, or too weird compared to the classic Fighter/Rogue/Wizard/Priest classes described in the core rulebook.</p><p>Although it didn&rsquo;t cause any serious problems in our campaign, it was an interesting challenge balancing combat encounters involving Brod, the tanky dwarven Pit Fighter with 30 HP, and Blotbug, the squishy goblin Witch with 5 HP.</p><p>I would suggest thinking carefully about allowing players to pick any of these extra classes in your campaign&ndash;especially for players new to roleplaying, who&rsquo;d be better served by playing a more iconic and simpler class.</p><p>For example, I regretted letting a player who&rsquo;d never done any roleplaying before pick the Seer class. It&rsquo;s a cool class but there&rsquo;s already enough for a player to think about when roleplaying their first time and I&rsquo;d rather they spend that energy on anything other than weird class mechanics, designed for players who already know how to roleplay.</p></section><section id=darkness-rules-are-hard-to-use><h3>Darkness rules are hard to use
<a href=#darkness-rules-are-hard-to-use>¶</a></h3><p>The only thing that isn&rsquo;t elegant about Shadowdark is its handling of darkness and how little it helps you run a fun game where light is a resource that has to be managed.</p><p>Unless you can figure out how to fill your dungeons with water-splashing enemies (like the book recommends) without making the dungeons feel more like waterparks, you&rsquo;re likely to run into the same problems I did with the darkness rules.</p><p>Thankfully, I found that the game works fine even if you mostly ignore these rules.</p><hr><p>In summary, Shadowdark is a really well-designed OSR dungeon crawling roleplaying system, but it&rsquo;s not perfect. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s delve into the centerpiece of this campaign: the Maze of the Blue Medusa.</p></section><section id=maze-of-the-blue-medusa><h1>Maze of the Blue Medusa
<a href=#maze-of-the-blue-medusa>¶</a></h1></section><section id=whats-cool-about-the-maze-of-the-blue-medusa><h2>What&rsquo;s cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?
<a href=#whats-cool-about-the-maze-of-the-blue-medusa>¶</a></h2><p>I read dozens of modules in preparation for running this campaign. I was looking for something special to give myself the solid foundation I felt like I needed to run my best campaign yet.</p><p>The Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon fit that bill perfectly&ndash;it&rsquo;s cool, it&rsquo;s out there, and it&rsquo;s also very me.</p></section><section id=great-abstract-surreal-art-combined-with-evocative-descriptions><h3>Great abstract, surreal art combined with evocative descriptions
<a href=#great-abstract-surreal-art-combined-with-evocative-descriptions>¶</a></h3><p>The Maze of the Blue Medusa is the product of a collaboration between Zak Sabbath and Patrick Stuart. Sabbath drew abstract, surreal room art and would send his art to Stuart, who would then write room descriptions based on that art. This back-and-forth continued for several years, producing the one-of-a-kind Maze of the Blue Medusa.</p><p>Despite this process, the megadungeon doesn&rsquo;t feel as much like a funhouse as you might expect. The megadungeon is partitioned into sections with common visual, literary, and gameplay themes, which helps connect the rooms together into a cohesive whole.</p></section><section id=weird-unique-npcs><h3>Weird, unique NPCs
<a href=#weird-unique-npcs>¶</a></h3><p>Interesting factions and NPCs inhabit the dungeon. You can leverage these to further connect the disparate sections of the maze with each other and, in doing so, make the dungeon come alive for your players.</p><p>There are hundreds of NPCs in the Maze of the Blue Medusa, and I can imagine any one of them becoming a character that your players never forget.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to understate how out-there and unique most of these NPCs are.</p></section><section id=everything-is-weird><h3>Everything is weird
<a href=#everything-is-weird>¶</a></h3><p>Despite providing ample classic dungeon-crawling puzzles and combat encounters, the Maze of the Blue Medusa refuses to play any of it straight&ndash;every room, every NPC, and every puzzle is a little surreal, a little absurdist, a little mythical, a little weird. That&rsquo;s what got me interested in the Maze of the Blue Medusa in the first place.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t disappoint. You can expect players to encounter psychic pigs, laughing liches, book-worms, robotic peacock butlers, cannibal critics (they eat artists)&ndash;I could go on.</p><p>As long as your players are open-minded enough to play in this off-beat fantasy setting, then the Maze of the Blue Medusa would be a great choice to include in your next OSR campaign.</p><p>It executes this weird vibe so well that, even though the megadungeon isn&rsquo;t perfect, what it does do well is so unique that it more than makes up for its minor failings.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s discuss what makes the Maze of the Blue Medusa less than perfect.</p></section><section id=whats-less-cool-about-the-maze-of-the-blue-medusa><h2>What&rsquo;s less cool about the Maze of the Blue Medusa?

<a href=#some-exceptionally-boring-rooms>¶</a></h3><p>The Maze of the Blue Medusa is a big megadungeon, and not all parts of it were created equally well. Overall, the quality of rooms is high, but there are a few that fall short.</p><p>An example is room 48 – Niu-Nga-Ma:</p><div class=spoiler aria-label=Spoiler><p>A shell, 8&rsquo; long, white, and patterned in green-white whorls the color of new leaves holding a layer of fresh unseasonal snow. Living in the shell is a large snail. Its limbs wave uncertainly like fingers seen through whiskey, somewhat transparent and indistinct.</p><p>Niu-Nga-Ma is not a true snail but a kind of golem created by Aelfadred The Glyph Witch (Gardens 58). She can hear anything the snail hears through a shell she keeps in her room. Likewise, Niu-Nga-Ma can hear anything that happens near the other shell.</p><p><strong>Niu-Nga-Ma</strong></p><p>AC 16, HD 4, ATK d8/d8</p></div><p>How a GM could make this &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; interesting is beyond me.</p><p>There are a few rooms in the Maze of the Blue Medusa that asked me to fill in the gaps way more than I was prepared for&ndash;these rooms left me scratching my head in confusion (which is never a good position for a GM to find themselves in at the table).</p><p>I imagine that a more well-prepared and experienced GM would be able to read a questionable room description like this one and decide to replace it with something else on the fly. That wasn&rsquo;t the case for me most of the time.</p></section><section id=some-players-wont-vibe-with-the-abstract-surreal-art><h3>Some players won&rsquo;t vibe with the abstract, surreal art
<a href=#some-players-wont-vibe-with-the-abstract-surreal-art>¶</a></h3><p>The room and NPC art in the Maze of the Blue Medusa tends to be quite abstract and doesn&rsquo;t often accurately convey what NPCs actually look like. This made it harder for the more visually inclined players in the group to imagine themselves in these spaces and around these NPCs.</p><p>This put a little extra pressure on me to describe NPCs in more evocative ways and to find less abstract art to use as token art to represent these NPCs on the VTT.</p><p>It was challenging because of the large number of NPCs in the megadungeon and their unique looks, which were often impossible to find exact or even close matches for.</p></section><section id=interactions-between-factions-are-mostly-left-for-the-gm-to-figure-out><h3>Interactions between factions are mostly left for the GM to figure out
<a href=#interactions-between-factions-are-mostly-left-for-the-gm-to-figure-out>¶</a></h3><p>The Maze of the Blue Medusa book could have done a better job of helping you run it by providing more examples of how the factions could interact with one another in interesting ways.</p><p>The book could have been much more explicit about this in more places, instead of leaving it mostly up to the GM to make all of these connections on their own.</p><p>For example,</p><div class=spoiler aria-label=Spoiler><p>Bringing the &ldquo;Oku&rdquo; (magical bird cosplayers, essentially), who are natural thieves and scavengers of knickknacks, into conflict with the Cannibal Critics, who are mostly feral zombies consuming artists in the art gallery, would be a great idea.</p><p>Interactions between factions like this aren&rsquo;t mentioned often in the book, and I think it&rsquo;d be better if they appeared more often.</p></div><hr><p>Despite these hiccups, the Maze of the Blue Medusa is still extraordinary. Next, let’s see how Shadowdark stacked up against this high-weirdness environment and vice versa.</p></section><section id=is-shadowdark-rpg-a-good-fit-for-running-the-maze-of-the-blue-medusa><h1>Is Shadowdark RPG a good fit for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa?
<a href=#is-shadowdark-rpg-a-good-fit-for-running-the-maze-of-the-blue-medusa>¶</a></h1><p>Short answer: no.</p><p>The Shadowdark RPG seems to want you to focus on the player characters&rsquo; struggle to light the path forward and avoid darkness at all costs.</p><p>Large sections of the Maze of the Blue Medusa are designed to be well-lit and wouldn&rsquo;t work at all if they weren&rsquo;t&ndash;which made it hard to implement Shadowdark&rsquo;s &ldquo;light as a resource&rdquo; mechanics in the campaign. Thankfully, the Shadowdark RPG system holds up even if you mostly ignore the darkness parts of the rules.</p><p>While I&rsquo;d consider running a Shadowdark RPG campaign again, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for running the Maze of the Blue Medusa without the caveats above.</p><hr><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered how the Shadowdark RPG supports, or doesn&rsquo;t, running the Maze of the Blue Medusa megadungeon&ndash;I&rsquo;ll now share the many lessons I learned from running this campaign.</p></section><section id=what-did-i-learn-gming-this-campaign><h1>What did I learn GMing this campaign?

This would make the world come alive for players and add more weight to their actions within the game.</p><p>Walking through the checklist would also give me a great opportunity to come up with ideas on how I might bring these reactions into focus for players, so they&rsquo;re made aware that their actions in previous sessions have had consequences and that the world is responding to them.</p><p>For example, if the PCs piss off a faction, that faction might decide to put a bounty on the party. In this case, I&rsquo;d write a <a href=/blog/2024-11-18/#bangs>bang</a> where a gang of bounty hunters run into the party, and I&rsquo;d also prep stat blocks for their leader and her mooks.</p><p>In a subsequent session, I&rsquo;d spring this previously prepared bang and throw these bounty hunters at the party.</p><p>Ideally, over time, I&rsquo;d be able to build a list of these &ldquo;world reacting to the players&rdquo; bangs and bring them into play at appropriate moments in later sessions to create more complex narrative throughlines, with the party juggling multiple faction/NPC relationships at once.</p></section><section id=provide-clear-direction-for-players-early-on><h3>Provide clear direction for players early on

I didn&rsquo;t confirm with players which direction they wanted to go in before the session ended. So, I prepped for both choices when instead I could have spent twice as much prep time on the path they ended up taking.</p><p>You might be wondering if that prep work really was wasted, presumably the party would have doubled back and taken that path.

<a href=#what-were-the-biggest-swings-im-most-proud-of-in-the-campaign>¶</a></h1><p>In running my Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon campaign, one of my goals was to try a bunch of stuff I&rsquo;d never done before&ndash;to learn from the experience of failing to do all of it perfectly, so I could bring that experience back to the table in my future roleplaying.</p><p>I found myself, more than I ever have before, comfortable with taking big swings as a GM, knowing that I was increasing the risk of missing. I decided to take that increased risk instead of playing it safe and learning much less from the experience as a result.</p><p>Here are a few of the bigger swings I took in this campaign and how they went:</p></section><section id=running-a-high-lethality-survival-horror-like-campaign><h2>Running a high-lethality survival horror-like campaign
<a href=#running-a-high-lethality-survival-horror-like-campaign>¶</a></h2><p>I set out with this campaign to make my players fear for their characters&rsquo; lives&ndash;I wanted combat encounters to feel tense and for every combat decision made by players to matter.</p><p>I think I mostly succeeded in running a high-tension, high-lethality campaign, even though no player characters died in regular combat encounters.</p><p>Almost every combat encounter had one or more PCs drop to 0 HP, be put in a &ldquo;downed but not out&rdquo; state, and remain a round or two away from dying more often than not.</p><p>To make these moments more thrilling, I &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the best rule from <a href=/books/mothership_1e/>Mothership 1E (Tuesday Knight Games)</a> and integrated it into the Shadowdark rules.</p><p>Whenever a player character dropped to 0 HP or below, I rolled a d4 and added the character&rsquo;s Constitution modifier to it. This produced a death timer representing the number of rounds the character had left before dying unless stabilized by an ally. I made these death timers secret information, like it&rsquo;s done in Mothership.</p><p>This made combat encounters universally tense. Almost every fight had a PC getting downed, and because the party didn&rsquo;t have a cleric, they had limited ways of stabilizing their allies without risk.</p><p>I <strong>never</strong> fudged the numbers with these death timers&ndash;there were quite a few times that a PC (usually Blotbug) was one round away from dying, but each time they were picked back up just in time.</p><p>That said, the survival horror / inventory management part of the campaign that I was hoping to deliver on was harder to make interesting than I thought it would be.</p><p>After the first few sessions, I reduced the emphasis on gathering torches and tracking food rations for resting because it wasn&rsquo;t adding much to the campaign.</p><p>However, this implied scarcity of resources early on did encourage players to engage in cannibalism and the eating of various other sapient-adjacent beings that they wouldn&rsquo;t have considered otherwise. This led to interesting, serendipitous, and unexpected opportunities for fun roleplaying.</p><p>For example, the eating of a size-changing psychic pig led to Freeya gaining the ability to commune with the psychic pig within himself to gather information from NPCs.</p><p>This ability acted as a sort of social lubricant that enabled him to connect with NPCs more easily and provided me with ample opportunities to reveal fun context about the labyrinth and its inhabitants.</p><p>So, in this case, me trying and failing to run a campaign focused on survival horror and inventory management with scarce resources led to creative roleplaying opportunities for everyone at the table that added a lot of spice to the campaign.</p></section><section id=running-a-megadungeon><h2>Running a megadungeon

<a href=#giving-npcs-unhinged-voices>¶</a></h2><p>Before running this campaign, I&rsquo;d never really tried to voice NPCs much differently from how I speak normally. I&rsquo;d put my tongue in my cheek or scrunch up my face to change my voice a bit, but this wasn&rsquo;t something I focused on much.</p><p>With this campaign, I set out to go big with my voices, spending a lot of time trying to both speak in a voice unlike my own and come up with believable things that NPCs would say.</p><p>Maybe this kind of thing comes naturally to some people, but it didn&rsquo;t for me. I had to put in a bunch of work to get better at it. Thankfully, it paid off.</p><p>An example was my voice for Germander. Here&rsquo;s his description for context:</p><blockquote><p>Germander is a 15&rsquo; long gray-pink worm with the most fucked up voice you can summon and features just this side of the uncanny valley, but is among the more agreeable creatures you’ll meet in the Maze.</p></blockquote><p>When the party encountered Germander for the first time, I described his appearance and unleashed the most unhinged voice I could come up with. It got a really positive reaction from my players.</p><p>Before the campaign started, I had told everyone that I would try and give unique voices to all the NPCs they might meet, but in that moment, I followed through and surprised them with my willingness to be ridiculous and fail repeatedly to keep my voices consistent.</p><p>Germander&rsquo;s voice and vibe were interesting enough that the players spent most of the campaign with him as their main patron&ndash;he would give them more reasons to explore, and the PCs went on a quest to find more books for Germander to read.</p><p><strong>speaks in cowboy voice</strong>: What can I say, partner? I must&rsquo;ve done something right because it sure felt good.

<a href=#creating-a-crazy-powerful-but-fun-magical-item-for-a-pc-to-cause-chaos-with>¶</a></h2><p>Spending some time with family one day after a session, I stumbled on a deck of Tarot cards (Travis McHenry&rsquo;s <em>Occult Tarot</em>, specifically) that was demon-themed&ndash;each card had a demon on it, along with a summary of the demon&rsquo;s vibe and &ldquo;powers.&rdquo;</p><p>After one particular session, the players requested more loot, including something relevant for each character.</p><p>So, I put two and two together, confirming with Freeya&rsquo;s player that the item I had in mind for their character&ndash;a demon-summoning deck&ndash;would be interesting.</p><p>They said yes. So I crafted a combat encounter where an enemy Chameleon Woman mage failed to use this demon-summoning deck effectively, dying in the process and leaving the deck to be picked up by Freeya after the other fascists were dealt with.</p><p>Over the course of the campaign, Freeya made use of the deck repeatedly and eventually learned how to use it more effectively, reducing the chance of summoning an uncooperative demon.</p><p>It turned out to be one of the most fun parts of the campaign for me to run&ndash;figuring out on the fly how each demon would fight, how they would influence battles, how they would sound, and what they&rsquo;d say was a ton of fun for everyone.</p><p>It had a big impact on the encounters it was used in, acting as a big power boost for the PCs&ndash;without it, they would have found themselves almost powerless to contend with the stronger threats in the labyrinth.</p><p>For example, Freeya&rsquo;s use of the demon-summoning Tarot deck contributed to Blotbug&rsquo;s death by sacrificial ritual late in the campaign. Cultists of the Shattered Moon ambushed the party, began &ldquo;moon dancing,&rdquo; and attempted to sacrifice Blotbug (which they&rsquo;d been trying to do since well before the start of the campaign).</p><p>In response, Freeya whipped out his deck and summoned Yuval, a dromedary demon who was really into making people become friends. One thing led to another, and Yuval compelled both the PCs and the cultists to become friends and collaborate on the ritual sacrifice of Blotbug.</p><p>This series of events didn&rsquo;t come completely out of the blue. Blotbug&rsquo;s player requested that Blotbug be killed off a few minutes before this particular session started, so I scrambled to set up an encounter where that could happen but wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed.</p><p>I got lucky that the PCs rolled extremely poorly in this encounter, making it much easier for me to carry out Blotbug&rsquo;s demise as requested. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I would have done if they&rsquo;d rolled really well&mldr; I guess we&rsquo;ll never know.</p><p>Prior to this encounter, the demon-summoning deck had mostly produced favorable results, although I tried to make it clear that no matter how much time Freeya spent trying to master the deck, it was always going to be risky&ndash;leaning into common tropes about demon summoning.</p><p>So when summoning a demon went wrong and led to a bad outcome for Blotbug, my hope is that it felt within reason, given the risk, and was fun to roleplay. I think it mostly worked out, which was a happy accident considering how short my prep time was to work these last-minute changes into the session.</p><p>None of this would have happened if I hadn&rsquo;t found this weird Tarot deck in real life and realized how cool it would be for a character to use in my campaign.</p><p>Although, the demon-summoning Tarot deck had such a big impact on encounters that I found myself failing to come up with ideas for what I could give other PCs that would be equally cool and impactful.</p><p>If I were to play another OSR campaign, I would try to come up with an ultimate item for each player character ahead of time so that when I need a cool item to give a specific character, I have something ready to go.</p><hr><p>Another big swing of mine was deciding to use Foundry Virtual Tabletop as a GM for the first time.
