<a href=/blog/2020-08-22/>previous one on online multiplayer video games</a>). I&rsquo;ll be
explaining how you can cheat in single-player games on PC. If you&rsquo;re feeling
like a rebel then take a seat and prepare to bask in the glow of infinite
health, infinite currency and infinity itself.</p><p>Feel free to use the techniques that I describe below at your own risk, I don&rsquo;t
advise cheating in any game that is a live service, is online in any way, has
leaderboards or has micro-transactions.</p><p>You&rsquo;re very unlikely to succeed in your #cheatinggoals using the techniques
discussed here in these cases and you might get into trouble by trying it.</p><p>Today, we&rsquo;ll be looking at the most basic kind of cheating: using a memory
scanner to scan for numbers being used in a game; allowing us to manipulate them
at will. I&rsquo;ll start by explaining the basics of how this works, then go into
more detail about how you can cheat and, finally, I&rsquo;ll discuss an example of a
game, Trials Rising, where cheaters using similar techniques to the one shown
below ruined the experience for everyone.</p><h1 id=basics>Basics
<a href=#basics>¶</a></h1><p>You may know that computers only understand two things: zero and one. Everything
that a computer does at some level is zeros and ones. In my previous blog post,
we looked at how we could transfer zeros and ones between computers to design an
online multiplayer video game experience.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll be looking at how we can manipulate zeros and ones on your own computer to
cheat in a single-player video game.</p><p>Zeros and ones are the fuel that make computer programs, including video games,
&ldquo;go&rdquo;. These zeros and ones have to physically exist somewhere on the computer.
They are stored in one of two places, in volatile storage or in non-volatile
storage.</p><p>The difference between the two is that turning off the power wipes your
computer&rsquo;s volatile storage clean but not your non-volatile storage. A form of
volatile storage that you might have heard of is RAM, or random-access memory.
As for non-volatile storage, you&rsquo;ve probably heard the terms hard disk drive
(HDD) or solid state drive (SSD), if you haven&rsquo;t, well, now you have!</p><p>Programs, photos, videos, everything really, exist on your non-volatile storage.
When you decide to play a game, a portion of it will be loaded into volatile
storage because accessing data from there is much quicker than doing so from
non-volatile storage.</p><p>Video games are considered to be &ldquo;real-time applications&rdquo; because you, as a big
G Gamer, expect the video games you play to react to your actions instantly. And
so, all the data that a video game requires to function like images, 3D models
and, most importantly for us, gameplay numbers (health, money, lives, character
position, score, etc.) can usually be found in RAM.</p><p>Loading screens, which may soon disappear due to SSDs being adopted in consoles,
disguise the game&rsquo;s loading of data from non-volatile storage into RAM. Open
world games tend to be so large that there&rsquo;s no reason to load the 3D models and
images (textures) for areas that are far from the player character into RAM, so
these are loaded dynamically during the course of play depending on where the
player decides to go.</p><p>So, if all the data that makes a video game, a video game exists in our
computer&rsquo;s RAM then if we can find the locations of these numbers in RAM, we can
modify them at will. This is the most basic way of cheating in a single-player
video game and I&rsquo;ll show you how to do it yourself, next.</p><h1 id=memory-scanning-with-cheat-engine>Memory Scanning with Cheat Engine
<a href=#memory-scanning-with-cheat-engine>¶</a></h1><blockquote><p>Before you do anything, one short PSA from me to you is that you should never
run an executable file from a source that you do not trust. An executable file
that you run can do ANYTHING it wants on your computer.</p></blockquote><p>Cheat Engine is a program which allows you to analyze the memory associated to
the programs that you are running on your computer, including your video games.
It allows you to find the locations in RAM where game variables are located
which then gives you control over them.</p><blockquote><p>Be careful when installing Cheat Engine, read every page of the installer
carefully, if you&rsquo;re not careful you&rsquo;ll install some adware and spyware
alongside it.</p></blockquote><p>Next, I&rsquo;ll cover the most basic use of Cheat Engine to give you a taste of what
it can do. Keep in mind, that Cheat Engine includes a great tutorial which I
highly recommend if you want to dig a little deeper.</p><p>The simplest way of using Cheat Engine is by choosing an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to manipulate
variable in your game. Money or skill points are usually a good choice because
these tend to be easy to change within the game. Also, the actual numerical
value, say 5, tied to these variables is usually visible to you which isn&rsquo;t
required but it is helpful.</p><p>Follow these steps to cheat:</p><ul><li>Launch your game.</li><li>Launch Cheat Engine, you&rsquo;ll be presented with list of processes (programs)
running on your computer, then select the game.</li><li>Choose your variable! Health, money, skill points, etc.</li><li>Enter the current value of the variable into the <em>Value</em> field and ensure that
the <em>Scan Type</em> dropdown is set to <em>Exact Value</em> then hit the <em>First Scan</em>
button. If you don&rsquo;t know the current value of the variable, for example for a
health bar without a number displayed, then make sure that the <em>Scan Type</em>
dropdown is set to <em>Unknown Initial Value</em> and finally hit the <em>First Scan</em>
button without specifying a value.</li><li>A list of locations in memory should appear in the box to the left. These are
all the possible locations in RAM where the variable you&rsquo;re searching for
might be found.</li><li>You need to narrow the list down to one entry to single out the location in
RAM tied to the variable you want to manipulate. You must now change the
variable&rsquo;s value within the game itself. For example, buying or selling
something if we&rsquo;re trying to find the location of the game&rsquo;s money variable.<ul><li>If you can see the new value of the number, you can type it into the <em>Value</em>
field, make sure to set the <em>Scan Type</em> dropdown menu to <em>Exact Value</em>, then
hit the <em>Next Scan</em> button. This will filter out all memory locations from
our previous search which aren&rsquo;t currently equal to the newly specified
value.</li><li>Otherwise, make sure to set the <em>Scan Type</em> dropdown menu to <em>Increased
value by&mldr;</em> or <em>Decreased value by&mldr;</em> as appropriate then hit the <em>Next
Scan</em> button. This will filter out all memory locations which haven&rsquo;t
changed in the way you&rsquo;ve specified.</li></ul></li><li>You might have to repeat this a few times, but, eventually, you should be able
to narrow the list down to one location. You can confirm that this is the
correct location in memory by looking at the number as you change it in-game
to make sure that the values match up.</li><li>You can now click on the memory location in the list to change its value.
Infinite money here we come!</li></ul><p>There you go! You&rsquo;re a cheater now. Loud and proud. You can do a lot more with
Cheat Engine such as automating the search for specific variables (the specific
locations will likely change every time you launch the game), creating cheat
&ldquo;tables&rdquo; to share with others, and more!</p><h1 id=ubisoft-strikes-again>Ubisoft Strikes Again
<a href=#ubisoft-strikes-again>¶</a></h1><p>Video game development is hard. So, game developers usually don&rsquo;t spend any of
their valuable time on preventing players from cheating using memory scanning
techniques in purely single-player games.</p><p>However, you might encounter a game that employs some form of obfuscation or
anti-cheat solution especially if you&rsquo;re being naughty and trying to cheat in a
game with leaderboards. This will make it a lot harder for you to cheat, maybe
impossible but probably not.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why leaderboards in most games are always filled with
cheaters, it&rsquo;s because no matter what game developers try to do it&rsquo;s difficult
to stop people from cheating in most games.</p><p>An indie game with leaderboards is probably going to be filled with cheaters
because it&rsquo;s likely that the game developers don&rsquo;t have the resources to create
a bulletproof implementation that prevents cheaters from cheating. AAA games
with leaderboards are also probably going to be filled with cheaters because if
there&rsquo;s a will then there&rsquo;s usually a way.</p><p>An example of how cheaters can ruin the experience for other players is Trials
Rising by our friends at Ubisoft. Trials is a time trials side scrolling
motorbike racing game series which I&rsquo;ve loved for over a decade. When Ubisoft
released the latest entry in the series last year, I was cautiously optimistic
(if you&rsquo;re interested you can
<a href=/reviews/2019-03-13/>watch or read my review of the game here</a>).</p><p>They mostly did a great job but they really messed up one, important, thing. For
months after release, players were unable to improve their times on certain
tracks. This is a critical issue because a lot of players enjoy fighting for
their spot on top of the leaderboard.</p><p>In these tracks, you were pitted against the ghosts of other players. OK? If you
weren&rsquo;t able to beat a certain number of these other players then you wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to post your improved time to the leaderboard.</p><p>Seems reasonable right?</p><p>Well, unfortunately, the top of the leaderboard for these tracks was filled with
cheaters and, only God knows why, the game would always make you race against
cheaters.</p><p>So, you would start the track, and then watch in horror as most of the other
players disappeared into thin air and instantly completed the race. As you can
imagine, it was impossible for legitimate players like me to beat these cheaters
which prevented me, and many other players, from improving our times on these
tracks and also prevented us from competing on the leaderboards.</p><p>Eventually they fixed the issue, and the rest of the game is really great. But,
I can&rsquo;t stop myself from taking a short detour to laugh at Ubisoft.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a href=#conclusion>¶</a></h1><p>We&rsquo;ve laughed, we&rsquo;ve cried, we&rsquo;ve hoped, we&rsquo;ve dreamed and, most importantly,
we&rsquo;ve cheated. You now have the tools to cheat in single-player games on your
computer. I hope that this post was interesting and instructive. If you have any
