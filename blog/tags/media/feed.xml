&lt;p>First, I&amp;rsquo;ll present evidence for the robot Brau1589 being an allusion to the Titan Prometheus from Greek mythology. Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss my thoughts on what &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; Brau1589 may have stolen from the gods, who the &amp;ldquo;gods&amp;rdquo; may be and who Brau1589 may have given the &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; to. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ll present some open questions that this allusion raises.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turbo Kid</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-28/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-28/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the Media Literacy (8th edition) textbook by W. James Potter recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a super interesting topic. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few passages that I&amp;rsquo;ve underlined in the text (I&amp;rsquo;ve read about half of the textbook so far).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully reading a few of these passages encourages you to pick up a media literacy textbook and start learning about the topic so that I can talk about it with you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring Marcus Aurelius's Meditations</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently read Marcus Aurelius&amp;rsquo;s Meditations (translated by Gregory Hays) and I quite enjoyed it. Some of his ideas are still relevant today and others haven&amp;rsquo;t aged very well (which is not surprising given how far removed Marcus&amp;rsquo;s experience of life is from our own).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the text was interesting enough for me to be motivated to make &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/bin/meditations/">this little toy that shows you one of the &amp;ldquo;meditations&amp;rdquo; every time you refresh the page&lt;/a> (tip: if you click/tap on a word it&amp;rsquo;ll bring you to another meditation containing that word).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>👉 🌐: 🤔 🌱 📃 🔠</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>EDIT 2022-08-22: Check out my new &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books">/books page&lt;/a> where I talk about books I&amp;rsquo;ve read and my thoughts on them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Johnny Mnemonic : Keanu Reeves in a business suit going insane in a dystopian cyberpunk world. Keanu&amp;rsquo;s inability to act and William Gibson&amp;rsquo;s inability to write only added to the charm of this movie. : The pile of trash that Johnny stands on when making his speech about wanting &amp;ldquo;room service&amp;rdquo; near the end of the movie represents the movie itself. : I was able to use this pile of trash as a stepping stone to introspect on the disillusionment one can feel as a white-collar worker living in a capitalist dystopia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Books I read in 2021</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-12-19/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-12-19/</guid><description>&lt;p>EDIT: &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/books">Check out my new /books page where I catalog all the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read since 2021 along with my thoughts about them&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

The men vying for the hand of his mother Penelope treat him like shit. Odysseus&amp;rsquo;s long absence has created a power vacuum in Ithaca and many suitors are now waiting in line to court and wed Penelope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Telemachus attempts to become less of a soy boy beta cuck by becoming more of a misogynist and treating his exceptionally beautiful and intelligent mother like crap.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
