&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new to roleplaying or just curious, &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/">take a look at my tabletop roleplaying 101 post&lt;/a> before reading this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Tabletop roleplaying works best when everyone at the table is fully invested in the world that the characters you&amp;rsquo;re playing exist in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone at the table should be fully bought in to the idea of all of you roleplaying together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips on achieving this and, in doing so, getting your players to care.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tabletop Roleplaying 101</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 09:15:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You, or someone you know, has expressed interest in participating in some form of tabletop roleplaying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is tabletop roleplaying?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tabletop roleplaying is a form of interactive storytelling. We&amp;rsquo;ve been telling each other stories sitting around a campfire for as long as anyone can remember. Tabletop roleplaying games are an extension of this. At their core, these games are all about people connecting with each other, creating shared experiences through play and discovering themselves by becoming someone else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sniper Elite 5's Axis Invasion Mode</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-06-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 21:04:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-06-02/</guid><description>Sniper Elite 5&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer Axis Invasion mode is really cool and here&amp;rsquo;s a few reasons why.</description></item><item><title>Get me out of here!</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like to play games.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, I guess I&amp;rsquo;m really into escape rooms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are escape rooms, you ask?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Borrowing elements from point-and-click adventure games, live-action role-playing, interactive theatre, treasure hunts, movies, and TV shows, an escape room is &amp;ldquo;a live-action team-based game where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually escaping from the room) in a limited amount of time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jacob Geller is a god, other people are not</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-18/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-18/</guid><description>&lt;p>Video game Youtube people like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JosephAndersonChannel/videos">Joseph Anderson&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/broadcaststsatic">Noah Caldwell-Gervais&lt;/a> (and many others) have been encouraged by the algorithm (and the way Youtube is monetized) to create longer and longer videos.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I played a few hours of VTOL VR today (streaming the Steam version to my Quest 2 using Virtual Desktop).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been super excited about planes and doing bombing runs on tiny white dots (collateral damage anyone?) bbuUuUuuuut I had a ton of fun. Maybe &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/reviews/2017-09-25/">I just like roleplaying as a terrible person&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VTOL VR, you&amp;rsquo;re a pilot of a fully-interactable yet simplified VTOL jet. The cockpit you&amp;rsquo;re in has a ton of fully functioning buttons, levers and joysticks that you use to pilot the jet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"That's never happened before" syndrome</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun">A speedrun is a play-through of a video game performed to complete it as quickly as possible&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Over the holidays, I played through the physics-based &amp;ldquo;astronaut doing astronauty things&amp;rdquo; game Heavenly Bodies. I played it once by myself, once more with a friend and, over the course of a week, I played all the way through it once or twice a day. I recorded myself playing and I tried to beat the game as fast as I could.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm not going to forget The Forgotten City</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>Each day I take off work is a pleasure, but each passing day off increases the sense of dread I feel about having to go back to work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a game about building teams of creatures to fight other teams of creatures. And that&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is it so compelling?&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved video games and writing so it seemed like a good idea to write about video games for fun.

I would play through a game from start to finish, pick out the juiciest parts of the experience, write about it in about 200 words and post the review to Steam. &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/reviews/">I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded them here if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in taking a look&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Political Video Game: Suzerain</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-04-05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-04-05/</guid><description>&lt;p>Suzerain is a text-based role-playing game where you play as President Anton Rayne leading the fictional country of Sordland in a political drama driven by conversations with your cabinet members and other significant people. The decisions you make will determine the future of Sordland and of its people, how will you lead?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suzerain is a narrative-driven game. Playing the game involves reading a lot of dialog, news articles, biographies of people and more. All of this text serves to immerse you in the political world of Sordland. Using its writing, Suzerain does everything it can to convince you that the people of Sordland are as real as you are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The PC master race is over: the Xbox Series X won</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-21/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I spent a lot of money purchasing an Xbox Series X. I&amp;rsquo;m encouraged to rationalize my purchases to make myself feel less bad about spending money on luxury instead hiding it away for a rainy day when I&amp;rsquo;m older and more broken than I am today. As always, I write honestly but, given the circumstances, take anything I say here with a grain of salt.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an understatement to say that I was introduced to video games at a young age. Somehow, I got my tiny little baby hands on a copy of Doom. Soon enough, I was blasting away at hordes of demons with high powered weaponry. I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that my younger more impressionable self became so engrossed in video games, as you know, I think some of them are quite compelling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Deduction through Text Chat in Untrusted</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-15/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-15/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky during these uncertain times to have been able to keep in touch with my close friends and forge new relationships through the internet.

&lt;p>I have a love-hate relationship with text chatting. It makes it really easy to keep in touch with the people you care about.

In the blink of an eye, the present becomes the past and the future becomes the present. Every moment spent standing still is a moment not spent moving forward. We&amp;rsquo;ve all been standing still for far too long, until we can move around again, let me tell you about a game where you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to stop moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Risk of Rain 2 is a game that forces you to come to terms with the passage of time.

&lt;p>I was, and unfortunately I still am, an early adopter of VR. I owned an HTC Vive headset a couple years ago, I sold it. I bought an Oculus Rift S soon after, I sold it.

One mistake and not only will you be going home empty handed; you&amp;rsquo;ll be returning to your friends and family in a coffin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Cheating in Single-Player Games</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to my second &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to&amp;rdquo; blog post (check out my &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/">previous one on online multiplayer video games&lt;/a>). I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining how you can cheat in single-player games on PC. If you&amp;rsquo;re feeling like a rebel then take a seat and prepare to bask in the glow of infinite health, infinite currency and infinity itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to use the techniques that I describe below at your own risk, I don&amp;rsquo;t advise cheating in any game that is a live service, is online in any way, has leaderboards or has micro-transactions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Online Multiplayer</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to my first &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to…&amp;rdquo;. This series of articles will cover a wide range of topics of interest to gamers from the perspective of a video game programmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know a little about what goes into making a video game. I gained a wide breadth of knowledge of every part of a video game including game engines, physics, gameplay, audio, AI, C++ (shiver) and more in my studies. In 2016, I was hired by an independent game studio, Borealys Games, to work on Mages of Mystralia as one of two programmers. Mages is a Zelda-like game where you find magical runes which you can combine to create your own spells to solve puzzles and fight enemies. After shipping the game and working on a cancelled project, I went on to Framestore VR where we built high-end VR experiences for installation in amusement parks (amusement parks in 2020, LOL). I&amp;rsquo;m not working in the video game industry anymore because making games is really hard and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard in a way that I enjoy. However, I&amp;rsquo;m as passionate about video games as ever. I just need to find other outlets for my love of video games, like writing about them!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You can always reload, until you can't</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most games don&amp;rsquo;t matter. The actions you play out within most games don&amp;rsquo;t have any long term impact on you as a player. Some narrative games imply that the choices you make have an impact on the world but given that the world is imaginary, does it really matter? Some RPGs force you into making decisions that change the world or your characters but&amp;hellip; You can always press F8 and reload.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Game of the Year List for 2019</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-01-17/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-01-17/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love video games. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved them almost my entire life. I loved them enough to make making them my job. I&amp;rsquo;m not working in video game development anymore but I still enjoy playing games and pondering over them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the video games I played in 2019 which I enjoyed the most (in no particular order).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-03-13/">my video review of Trials Rising&lt;/a> which I wrote and recorded earlier this year during my extended break from employment (don&amp;rsquo;t expect any more reviews to come where that came from).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Warhammer 40k - a Blast from the Past</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-08-28/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-08-28/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently dove head first into the world of Warhammer 40k. A dark and edgy tabletop game born in the 80s played with many miniature models of science fiction soldiers, aliens, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of space orks (generic fantasy orcs thrust forty thousand years into the future) who paint their ships red because it makes them go faster (their belief makes it so) or about an immortal Emperor sending genetically modified soldiers all over the universe to defeat the forces of Chaos then that&amp;rsquo;s Warhammer 40k.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Influencing the odds inside and outside of Blood Bowl 2</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-05-07/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-05-07/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Blood Bowl 2 smashes Warhammer and American football together, in an explosive cocktail of turn-based strategy, humour and brutality, adapted from Games Workshop&amp;rsquo;s famous board game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to come up with a better brief description of what Blood Bowl is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Blood Bowl, you take on the role of a coach leading and managing a team playing an extremely violent mockery of American football. During a match, two teams try to carry one ball from one end of the pitch to the other but the similarities between football and Blood Bowl end there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The website, Mortal Kombat 11 and microtransactions</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-04-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-04-24/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on my website (the one you&amp;rsquo;re currently on, I should probably put a &amp;ldquo;work-in-progress&amp;rdquo; sign up&amp;hellip;). Work has been going well so far. I had done most of the &amp;lsquo;setting everything up&amp;rsquo; for the site a year and a half ago before I was employed by Framestore VR.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently begun working on the project again, and the work has been going according to plan. I was expecting to spend the whole day working on on the website yesterday however Mortal Kombat 11&amp;rsquo;s story mode and juicy gameplay got in the way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
