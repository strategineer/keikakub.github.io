&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in the flight simulator space, the video game world, in special effects and, most recently, in financial services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>débrouillard&lt;/em> meaning that no matter what problem you throw at me, inevitably, I&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out and solve it. I thrive in environments where there&amp;rsquo;s lots of interesting problems to solve.

&lt;p>I played a few hours of VTOL VR today (streaming the Steam version to my Quest 2 using Virtual Desktop).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been super excited about planes and doing bombing runs on tiny white dots (collateral damage anyone?) bbuUuUuuuut I had a ton of fun. Maybe &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/reviews/2017-09-25/">I just like roleplaying as a terrible person&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In VTOL VR, you&amp;rsquo;re a pilot of a fully-interactable yet simplified VTOL jet. The cockpit you&amp;rsquo;re in has a ton of fully functioning buttons, levers and joysticks that you use to pilot the jet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thought Exercise #1</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a big (but portable) blue button with the word &amp;ldquo;KILL&amp;rdquo; painted on it (called the kill button).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So here I am, living through a day that&amp;rsquo;s shorter than it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be. And yet, I still want to do everything I had initially planned to do but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to. Well, what can you do? I&amp;rsquo;ll remember to set my alarm today and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do as much as I can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cutting my own hair</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been cutting my own hair for the past few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A decent hair trimmer costs as much as a single haircut. If you can learn how to cut your own hair with one then you can save a little time and money.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to give yourself a buzzcut then buy yourself a hair trimmer and enjoy saving yourself time and money by cutting your own hair.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I don&amp;rsquo;t like the way buzzcuts look on me so I need to do a little more work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cutting my own hair well is hard. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t take me many haircuts to learn how to do it semi-competently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cutting my hair right before I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to appear in public is a big mistake. I need to wait a day or two for my hair to grow out a little to cover up any of the mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve made near the ears and back of the neck.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Except for my first haircut or two (which were so questionable that people commented on it), nobody has noticed that I cut my own hair.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>But, people have yet to really be wowed by my haircuts&amp;hellip; If you want to look extremely sexy for a few days after you cut your hair, there&amp;rsquo;s no shortcut. Go to a professional and pray they don&amp;rsquo;t fuck it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I cut my hair in one of two ways:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Generic Short Haircut (very short hair at neck level, short hair at ear level and longer hair on top of my head).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generic Short Alternative Haircut (same thing except a little more hair on top, think mini Pompadour).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>These hair styles are nothing special but at least I don&amp;rsquo;t look like a Neo-Nazi.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>A (work)day in the life</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-11-01/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>6:30am.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wake up. It&amp;rsquo;s still dark outside. I sit on the toilet bowl and piss. I get up and walk over to my closet. I pull out some socks, pajama pants or shorts depending on the weather and a polo shirt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get dressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I walk over to my living room. I take my phone off its wireless charger and check to see if I received any messages in the middle of the night (probably not). I take my water bottle and fill it up with future piss if I need to.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
