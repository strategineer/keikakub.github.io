&lt;p>Sleepaway is a horror TTRPG where players each play a camp counselor in a camp of their own creation suffering from the evil and chaotic influence of the Lindworm (like John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s The Thing but more lovecraftian).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Potluck of TTRPG Mechanics</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2025-05-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2025-05-19/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most of the tabletop RPG systems that I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with are gathering together today to party like it&amp;rsquo;s 2025 and they&amp;rsquo;ve all brought something to the table (my brain).&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s been the most successful of my attempts at Gamemastering by far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about GMing since the first time I tried it sometime in the mid-00s. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in love with the platonic ideal of tabletop roleplaying for a long time.

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips on achieving this and, in doing so, getting your players to care.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tabletop Roleplaying 101</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 09:15:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</guid><description>&lt;p>So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is tabletop roleplaying?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tabletop roleplaying is a form of interactive storytelling. We&amp;rsquo;ve been telling each other stories sitting around a campfire for as long as anyone can remember.
