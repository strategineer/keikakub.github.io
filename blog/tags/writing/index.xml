      <description>On and off, since early 2017, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about the video games I play. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved video games and writing so it seemed like a good idea to write about video games for fun. I got into the habit of writing concise reviews for most of the video games I played. I would play through a game from start to finish, pick out the juiciest parts of the experience, write about it in about 200 words and post the review to Steam.</description>
