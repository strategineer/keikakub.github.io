&lt;p>I was sitting there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Waiting for my changes to appear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watching the clock tick away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contemplating the reality that every second I spend waiting for my build to finish is a second that I&amp;rsquo;m never going to get back.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Turns out there was. All of a sudden, I spent an entire weekend gutting my website, ripping out Middleman, the static site generator I was using, and replacing it with Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vim plugins I like</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-10/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vim is a text editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for over 6 years now and I&amp;rsquo;m madly in love with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re married to the command line like I am (or want to be), then getting over Vim&amp;rsquo;s steep learning curve will be well worth the effort. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://romainl.github.io/the-patient-vimmer/0.html">quite a few good resources out there to help non-Vim users get acquainted with it&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What makes Vim so cool?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vim is powerful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Undiscording yourself 101</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="#how-to-delete-all-your-messages-on-a-discord-server">Skip ahead if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and just want to learn how to delete all your messages on a Discord server&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Discord is a social media platform allowing users in various user-created groups, called servers, to chat with each other through text or voice chat and stream video of themselves or their screen, all in real time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Text messages are stored on the server forever and aren&amp;rsquo;t automatically deleted no matter how old they are or currently relevant they are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring Marcus Aurelius's Meditations</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-26/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently read Marcus Aurelius&amp;rsquo;s Meditations (translated by Gregory Hays) and I quite enjoyed it. Some of his ideas are still relevant today and others haven&amp;rsquo;t aged very well (which is not surprising given how far removed Marcus&amp;rsquo;s experience of life is from our own).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, the text was interesting enough for me to be motivated to make &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/bin/meditations/">this little toy that shows you one of the &amp;ldquo;meditations&amp;rdquo; every time you refresh the page&lt;/a> (tip: if you click/tap on a word it&amp;rsquo;ll bring you to another meditation containing that word).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baby's First 3D Models for Printing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-04/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-04/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of buying a 3D printer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in but until recently I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the space for it. The consumer 3D printing world has gotten a lot cheaper and simpler to get into in recent years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In preparation for that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with OpenSCAD. It&amp;rsquo;s a CAD (Computer-aided design) program which, according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">Wikipedia&lt;/a>, is a computer program used to aid in the creation, modification, analysis or optimization of a design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Second Coming of Rust</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-19/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-19/</guid><description>&lt;p>In these UNCERTAIN TIMES, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself with a little more free time than usual because I haven&amp;rsquo;t needed to commute to an office every day. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to funnel that energy into creative and constructive hobbies. Keyword: &lt;em>tried&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some of that time learning the Rust programming language. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of good things about it and I finally took the plunge. Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of notable features that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to grok from my brief time with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Cheating in Single-Player Games</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to my second &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to&amp;rdquo; blog post (check out my &lt;a href="https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/">previous one on online multiplayer video games&lt;/a>). I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining how you can cheat in single-player games on PC. If you&amp;rsquo;re feeling like a rebel then take a seat and prepare to bask in the glow of infinite health, infinite currency and infinity itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to use the techniques that I describe below at your own risk, I don&amp;rsquo;t advise cheating in any game that is a live service, is online in any way, has leaderboards or has micro-transactions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Online Multiplayer</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to my first &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide toâ€¦&amp;rdquo;. This series of articles will cover a wide range of topics of interest to gamers from the perspective of a video game programmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know a little about what goes into making a video game. I gained a wide breadth of knowledge of every part of a video game including game engines, physics, gameplay, audio, AI, C++ (shiver) and more in my studies. In 2016, I was hired by an independent game studio, Borealys Games, to work on Mages of Mystralia as one of two programmers. Mages is a Zelda-like game where you find magical runes which you can combine to create your own spells to solve puzzles and fight enemies. After shipping the game and working on a cancelled project, I went on to Framestore VR where we built high-end VR experiences for installation in amusement parks (amusement parks in 2020, LOL). I&amp;rsquo;m not working in the video game industry anymore because making games is really hard and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard in a way that I enjoy. However, I&amp;rsquo;m as passionate about video games as ever. I just need to find other outlets for my love of video games, like writing about them!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interviews - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-06-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-06-26/</guid><description>&lt;p>Looking for a job sucks. A couple of months ago, I was going through interview after interview like a wrecking ball blasting through concrete. No buildings were destroyed in the process but I may have burned some bridges along the way. We laughed, we cried, it was roller coaster of emotions and then I got a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a blow-by-blow review of the interviews I went through. I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected on each interview and coupled each with recommendations for you if you are or are planning to go through a similar interview process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I code review an 8 year old project</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-12/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the first projects I worked on after learning how to program, around 8 years ago, is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeikakuB/writerator/tree/legacy">writerator&lt;/a>. It is a Python command line interface (or CLI for short) for analyzing English language text and generating randomized poetry such as haikus and poems. I was contemplating using it to build a new side project which would analyze text from all over the internet from the previous day (news articles, Twitter posts, etc.), then generate a new short poem every day using the words from the analyzed text and post it to Twitter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a website for 17$ or less</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-08/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-08/</guid><description>&lt;p>The website you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on was built by myself and it cost me a total of 17$ CDN (yearly). Without a custom domain it would have cost me nothing, zilch, nada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal for this website was to create my own space on the internet to allow me to easily share the software engineering work I&amp;rsquo;ve done, share the writing I do on video games and encourage me to write about other topics that interest me.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
