&lt;p>I want to say a lot but I don&amp;rsquo;t always know how to express myself in the best way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Teddy, an academic with a desire to gain political power for yet to be determined reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And myself, Blade. Ostracised from the Academy for my &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; research, I took to the streets where my ability to make things go boom would be put to good use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Positive Thinking by Vincent B.
