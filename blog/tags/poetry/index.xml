      <description>https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/twilightSoundscapeGenerator.php
Twinkling stars blinking in and out of existence.
The thought of the sound of space.
Weightless, floating, breathing in and out forever.
An alien hand reaches out, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be OK&amp;rdquo; they said.
Time stopped, and I looked inward to find myself.
Forgiving yourself for mistakes made and ones you&amp;rsquo;ve yet to make.
The liminal space between your past and your present selves.</description>

      <description>A dark and dank cave, you see,
Murky and mouldy, walls surrounding me.
It feels safe, or at least, it used to,
Now, my monsters keep me company.
A tiny ray of light seeps through,
A gentle warmth between my toes.
Cup your ear and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear,
The sound of those I left behind,
Praying for my salvation.</description>

      <description>Sifting through the filtered photographs
Left and right, left and right
It was love at first swipe.
 Balsamic vinegar,
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s healthy&amp;rdquo;, they said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s good for you.&amp;rdquo;
But, healthy salad makes me a sad lad.
 Choking on a piece of bread,
&amp;ldquo;Chew before you swallow&amp;rdquo;, they said,
I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen and now I&amp;rsquo;m dead.
 Flames engulf us,
As I hold on to you, tight.
Are you feeling this?</description>

      <title>Beetles, bravery and brotherhood</title>

      <description>Let the beetles beat their drums
Waves reflecting off the sun
Yet, the war has just begun
 Previously potted plant, shards everywhere
Uprooted but far from death,
A survivor, stronger than ever
Mint never gave up.
 Twelve or more weeks later, disremembered
Gone forever but not forgotten
Brother, who would you have been?</description>
