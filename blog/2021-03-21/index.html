I&rsquo;m encouraged to rationalize my purchases to make myself feel less bad about spending money on luxury instead hiding it away for a rainy day when I&rsquo;m older and more broken than I am today. As always, I write honestly but, given the circumstances, take anything I say here with a grain of salt.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a bit of an understatement to say that I was introduced to video games at a young age. Somehow, I got my tiny little baby hands on a copy of Doom. Soon enough, I was blasting away at hordes of demons with high powered weaponry. I&rsquo;m not surprised that my younger more impressionable self became so engrossed in video games, as you know, I think some of them are quite compelling.</p><p>I started out as a PC gamer but that didn&rsquo;t last long. From the time I was given an original PlayStation console as a kid until I bought a PlayStation 3 with a hard-earned paycheck from my first summer job, I&rsquo;ve been doing most of my gaming on consoles.</p><p>A few years after buying the PlayStation 3, I started working at my first internship and spent a few paychecks worth of money on building the biggest dick gaming PC you can imagine (at the time). I&rsquo;m writing this on that same PC actually. Since then, it&rsquo;s gone through a couple of upgrades and I&rsquo;ve had to resurrect it more than once, but it works&mldr;</p><p>Usually.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for so long that the next time it dies on me, it won&rsquo;t be worth the effort to bring it back to life again. I&rsquo;ve been looking to purchase a new PC for a while now. But, as you may know, we&rsquo;ve been experiencing major global shortages in graphics cards because of supply chain issues caused by COVID-19, scalpers, and cryptocurrency miners. Because of this, I don&rsquo;t expect to be able to buy a more reliable and beefier PC for a reasonable price anytime soon.</p><p>So, I signed my PC gamer soul away and started looking to get my hands on one of these new consoles. You can&rsquo;t buy a PlayStation 5 right now because of supply shortages so I ignored it and set my sights on an Xbox Series X without thinking about it too much.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft&rsquo;s monthly subscription service that gives you access to a large library of games that you can play on PC or on the Xbox One, Series X/S. There&rsquo;s a bunch of interesting games on there I&rsquo;d like to play like Wasteland 3. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t play these games on my TV through Steam Big Picture (<a href=/blog/2020-11-15/>I talk about how I run games on PC and stream them to my living room TV here</a>). These days, I try to do most of my gaming on my couch to try and separate my job from the rest of my life as much as I can. The only way for me to play these Xbox Game Pass games comfortably is by getting a console.</p><p>So, Xbox Series X it is. I spent a week with a tab open on a website that alerts you whenever the Xbox Series X is in stock somewhere online. Everyone is looking to buy a console right now; the Xbox Series Xs seem to sell out within a few minutes of them being in stock. So, to snag one, you have to be lucky and quick.</p><p>I heard the alarm and smashed the &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; button as fast as I could a few times. I was mostly unsuccessful. Eventually, I got lucky and it worked. I unboxed an Xbox Series X the next day, signed up for Xbox Game Pass and started having a great time.</p><p>This console rocks. Here&rsquo;s a few reasons why.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got a very old gaming PC, it&rsquo;s not able to run most AAA games well anymore. Spending a quarter (or less) of the price I spent building my PC to purchase a console that can run games way better is objectively great. But what makes it such a good deal, is undeniably Xbox Game Pass. They doubled the price of the service a few months ago, and they&rsquo;ll probably do it again, but for now ten to fifteen US dollars a month is an amazing price for what you get. Especially now that most of the games that ZeniMax Media / Bethesda Softworks has developed and published (the Elder Scrolls, Prey, Dishonored, Doom Eternal, etc.) have been added to the service as well as all of the EA Play (Electronic Art&rsquo;s version of Xbox Game Pass) games. It&rsquo;s a really good deal for someone like me who plays games once and rarely goes back to play them again.</p><p>If you want to play Xbox Game Pass games on your couch with a great controller, the Xbox Series X is an easy way of doing that.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to convey just how good the new Xbox controller feels in my hands. In the past, when given the choice, I&rsquo;ve gravitated towards using the modern PlayStation controllers over the Xbox ones. But… The new Xbox controller feels so goooooooooooood. The d-pad is the best d-pad I&rsquo;ve touched in my entire life. The triggers are buttery smooth. The textured grip of the controller feels like a freshly groomed dog&rsquo;s fur. Using this new Xbox controller has convinced me to ditch the DualSense controller I purchased a few months ago, and buy another new Xbox Controller to use when I play games on my PC.</p><p>There&rsquo;s only so much I can do to convince you that these new controllers are the bomb, you&rsquo;ll have to try it yourself. If you&rsquo;ve played games on the Xbox 360 or Xbox One with those controllers, take a moment to imagine how that feels&mldr;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not perfect but it&rsquo;s pretty good. Right? Well, this new controller is better in all the ways that you can (or can&rsquo;t) imagine.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve touched those old controllers at some point in your life, you might also have some nostalgia for older Xbox games. If so, the Xbox Series X has you covered.</p><p>Surprisingly, a good number of Xbox and Xbox 360 games can be played on the Xbox Series X if you&rsquo;ve got the disks laying around. If you don&rsquo;t, a smaller but significant number of them can be purchased digitally for reasonable prices (at least compared to Nintendo LOL). The Xbox Series X can run all Xbox One games and you&rsquo;ll see some performance improvements on some of them. Games have changed a lot since the older Xbox consoles came out so I don&rsquo;t expect to be playing many older games myself. But I can&rsquo;t deny that what Microsoft has achieved with backwards compatibility is impressive and that you might be interested in it.</p><p>Backwards compatibility is great for players who want to dive into games they&rsquo;ve enjoyed in the past. This next feature, and the most interesting, is thrusting us forward into the future.</p><p>&ldquo;Quick Resume. Quick Resume. Quick Resume.&rdquo;</p><p><em>waves arms around hysterically</em></p><p>Quick Resume is a feature that makes pausing a game and coming back to it later as seamless as possible. If I&rsquo;m playing a game to relax, another game to write an essay about and a fun local cooperative game with family (this is a pretty common pattern for me these days), I can switch between all these games at will, the console will remember exactly where I left off in each them and put me right back where I was as soon as I decide to play the game again.</p><p>It&rsquo;s craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzy.</p><p>It makes it so easy for me to take a step back from the games I&rsquo;m playing whenever I feel like and come back to them whenever I want. Quick Resume is a substantial evolution in console design that makes playing games much more convenient than they were previously. I imagine Quick Resume would be a godsend for people who had Xbox consoles as kids, who&rsquo;ve grown up and might have kids of their own now.</p><p>So, ya. That&rsquo;s it. The Xbox Series X is really cool. I&rsquo;m glad that I make enough money to feed myself, put a roof over my head and buy myself boxes that I can play video games on. But, things don&rsquo;t make you happy, experiences do. I can&rsquo;t have many experiences right now and so I&rsquo;m happy to live vicariously through the video games I entertain myself with for the time being.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll see you on the other side.</p><p>Boyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-04-05/>◀️A Political Video Game: Suzerain</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2021-03-15/>▶️Social Deduction through Text Chat in Untrusted</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent blog posts</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-08/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Human-Flavored Soup: Soup-Flavored Human</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-06-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Sniper Elite 5's Axis Invasion Mode</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-26/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Five Reasons to build your website with Hugo</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-10/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Vim plugins I like</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-28/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Turbo Kid</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 48 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
