Tabletop roleplaying works best when everyone at the table is fully invested in the world that the characters you&amp;rsquo;re playing exist in.
Everyone at the table should be fully bought in to the idea of all of you roleplaying together.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips on achieving this and, in doing so, getting your players to care.</description></item><item><title>On Being Awesome (1)</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-17/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 19:14:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-17/</guid><description>Nick Riggle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;On Being Awesome: A Unified Theory of How Not to Suck&amp;rdquo; is a philosophy book that discusses awesomeness and suckiness in detail. It defines language to accurately describe and reason about the awesomeness and suckiness that you perceive in yourself and in others.
According to Mr. Riggle, awesomeness and suckiness revolves all around social openings which are moments when we can choose to break out of our norm-governed roles by expressing ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Tabletop Roleplaying 101</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 09:15:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-14/</guid><description>So&amp;hellip;
You, or someone you know, has expressed interest in participating in some form of tabletop roleplaying.
What is tabletop roleplaying?
Tabletop roleplaying is a form of interactive storytelling. We&amp;rsquo;ve been telling each other stories sitting around a campfire for as long as anyone can remember. Tabletop roleplaying games are an extension of this. At their core, these games are all about people connecting with each other, creating shared experiences through play and discovering themselves by becoming someone else.</description></item><item><title>Got to Go Fast</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 09:40:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-11/</guid><description>Yesterday I discussed me getting back into intermittent fasting and the individualistic (and very Western) reasons why.
The short of it is: I want to feel good about my body, I want people to find me attractive and one way I can go about that is by slimming down a little.
Now, are there less selfish reasons why someone would decide to start fasting?
Well, of course, fasting, and dietary restrictions in general, are commonly practiced in many faiths.</description></item><item><title>Sentient Potatoes: The Future of War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-10/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 19:52:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-10/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;m doing intermittent fasting again.
It works for me. It helps me reduce my weight in a sustainable way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t disrupt my life (too much).
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose much weight.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have to.
From my very unbiased perspective, I can assure you that losing 10 pounds would be enough to bring me to very sexy man level. Theoretically (I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen but who knows), losing 20 pounds would bring me to sexy Greek God level.</description></item><item><title>The Poltergeist Salad Tossed Itself</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 10:48:37 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-09/</guid><description>We like to believe that we are free (as in freedom).

I want to say a lot but I don&amp;rsquo;t always know how to express myself in the best way.
My thoughts are vague and opaque within my own mind, rarely I&amp;rsquo;m able take these thoughts and convey them in a way that makes sense. A way that clicks with people and allows them to understand a tiny fraction of the way I feel inside.
I solemnly pledge to spend more time writing my thoughts down on paper before they can float away in the never-ending churn that is the human brain.</description></item><item><title>Sniper Elite 5's Axis Invasion Mode</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-06-02/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 21:04:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-06-02/</guid><description>Sniper Elite 5&amp;rsquo;s multiplayer Axis Invasion mode is really cool and here&amp;rsquo;s a few reasons why.</description></item><item><title>Five Reasons to build your website with Hugo</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-26/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-26/</guid><description>I was making some small changes to my website last week, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what I was doing.
I was sitting there.
Waiting for my changes to appear.
Watching the clock tick away.
Contemplating the reality that every second I spend waiting for my build to finish is a second that I&amp;rsquo;m never going to get back.
There&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way!
Turns out there was. All of a sudden, I spent an entire weekend gutting my website, ripping out Middleman, the static site generator I was using, and replacing it with Hugo.</description></item><item><title>I wrote this on my phone</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-23/</guid><description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m using GitHub Actions to deploy my website I&amp;rsquo;m able to write something on my phone, push it to GitHub and Voila!

For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending hours each week: planning what I&amp;rsquo;m going to eat when, getting ingredients and doing the cooking itself.
It&amp;rsquo;s tough and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.
So, I wanted to take a little break from all that work to focus on activities that make me happy while keeping myself fed and healthy.</description></item><item><title>I'm not laughing, you're laughing...</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-26/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-26/</guid><description>Documental is a Japanese reality TV show with a simple premise.
10 comedians (ponying up 1 million Yen each) are locked in a room for 6 hours with cameras filming everything that happens inside.
If one of them smiles or laughs, they get a yellow card. If they do it again, they&amp;rsquo;re kicked out of the room.
The last comedian left in the room after 6 hours have past is declared the winner, and receives a 10 million Yen prize.</description></item><item><title>Undiscording yourself 101</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-25/</guid><description>Skip ahead if you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and just want to learn how to delete all your messages on a Discord server.

What are escape rooms, you ask?
Borrowing elements from point-and-click adventure games, live-action role-playing, interactive theatre, treasure hunts, movies, and TV shows, an escape room is &amp;ldquo;a live-action team-based game where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually escaping from the room) in a limited amount of time&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Myself</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-18/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-18/</guid><description>Hi, my name&amp;rsquo;s [NAME].

Twinkling stars blinking in and out of existence.
The thought of the sound of space.
Weightless, floating, breathing in and out forever.
An alien hand reaches out, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be OK&amp;rdquo; they said.
Time stopped, and I looked inward to find myself.
Forgiving yourself for mistakes made and ones you&amp;rsquo;ve yet to make.
The liminal space between your past and your present selves.</description></item><item><title>Untitled - Poem #21973</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-10/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-04-10/</guid><description>A dark and dank cave, you see,
Murky and mouldy, walls surrounding me.

A gentle warmth between my toes.
Cup your ear and you&amp;rsquo;ll hear,
The sound of those I left behind,
Praying for my salvation.</description></item><item><title>TLDR: Media Literacy by W.

Hopefully reading a few of these passages encourages you to pick up a media literacy textbook and start learning about the topic so that I can talk about it with you!</description></item><item><title>The Overjustification Effect</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-24/</guid><description>I learned to code sometime in 2011. I started getting paid to code in 2016.
What started out as a passion turned into a job. This sometimes leads to what&amp;rsquo;s called the overjustification effect.
The overjustification effect occurs when an expected external incentive such as money or prizes decreases a person&amp;rsquo;s intrinsic motivation to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as motivational &amp;ldquo;crowding out&amp;rdquo;. The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation.</description></item><item><title>A bar fight to remember</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-09/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-03-09/</guid><description>We found ourselves at the abandoned mine shaft, home to the mysterious entity we call the Eye.

Overall, the text was interesting enough for me to be motivated to make this little toy that shows you one of the &amp;ldquo;meditations&amp;rdquo; every time you refresh the page (tip: if you click/tap on a word it&amp;rsquo;ll bring you to another meditation containing that word).</description></item><item><title>F*** dating apps</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-01-23/</guid><description>As discussed in my first entry of my previous series of posts, we are motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards that encourage us to spend our valuable time on certain activities rather than others.

I moved out of my family&amp;rsquo;s place a little more than a year ago. In the time since, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced a lot, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and I&amp;rsquo;ve grown. Given that I&amp;rsquo;ve just moved out again somewhere new, why not reflect on the time that I spent living away from my family and share that with you.</description></item><item><title>Chronic Pain and HUGE Trackballs</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-11/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-11/</guid><description>WARNING: If you&amp;rsquo;ve got pain in your body, listen to it. If you&amp;rsquo;re a big Gamer, please take breaks and play responsibly. Video games are wonderful but they aren&amp;rsquo;t worth destroying your mind and body over playing them, or making them. You&amp;rsquo;ll thank me later.
I recently started using an ELECOM HUGE trackball mouse. Trackball mice are an alternative to traditional mice. Instead of moving the mouse around, you rotate a ball that&amp;rsquo;s fixed in place (the trackball) using your fingers which then moves the mouse cursor on the screen.</description></item><item><title>Baby's First 3D Models for Printing</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-04/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-10-04/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of buying a 3D printer&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in but until recently I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the space for it. The consumer 3D printing world has gotten a lot cheaper and simpler to get into in recent years.
In preparation for that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with OpenSCAD. It&amp;rsquo;s a CAD (Computer-aided design) program which, according to Wikipedia, is a computer program used to aid in the creation, modification, analysis or optimization of a design.</description></item><item><title>Power Fantasies, Environments in LoG 2</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-28/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-28/</guid><description>The world around us is mysterious, magnificent and beautiful. It&amp;rsquo;s a living breathing ecosystem with an internal logic of its own. Mother Nature, and Father Concrete, represent the interwoven complexity held within the environments that we live in and explore.
In the real world, the environments we inhabit can be quite uninteresting, but anything is possible in a video game.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing Legend of Grimrock 2 recently. I&amp;rsquo;m having a wonderful time, because the environment is more than just a place where gameplay happens, it IS the gameplay.</description></item><item><title>The Second Coming of Rust</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-19/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-19/</guid><description>In these UNCERTAIN TIMES, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself with a little more free time than usual because I haven&amp;rsquo;t needed to commute to an office every day. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to funnel that energy into creative and constructive hobbies. Keyword: tried.
In the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some of that time learning the Rust programming language. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of good things about it and I finally took the plunge. Here&amp;rsquo;s a couple of notable features that I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to grok from my brief time with it.</description></item><item><title>My favorite games of the past, present and future</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-13/</guid><description>Hello fellow human.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been quite busy this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of my free time on modding, making changes to an existing game, of a newly released game which I&amp;rsquo;ve been pouring a lot of time into given how good it is (I&amp;rsquo;ll mention it later on).
Today will be a little less formal (that&amp;rsquo;s just a nicer way of me saying that it&amp;rsquo;ll be a little more half-assed than usual).</description></item><item><title>Hunt, Showdown, Repeat</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-04/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-09-04/</guid><description>You are a bounty hunter dredging through demon-infested Louisiana swamps in an alternate timeline of our 1895 but with some anachronisms thrown in. You need to find, then kill a demonic monster and, finally, leave the swamp as quickly as you can. Problem is… You&amp;rsquo;re not alone.
You better hope to God that you brought the right weapons and that you&amp;rsquo;re not caught off guard by other bounty hunters. One mistake and not only will you be going home empty handed; you&amp;rsquo;ll be returning to your friends and family in a coffin.</description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Cheating in Single-Player Games</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-30/</guid><description>Welcome to my second &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to&amp;rdquo; blog post (check out my previous one on online multiplayer video games). I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining how you can cheat in single-player games on PC. If you&amp;rsquo;re feeling like a rebel then take a seat and prepare to bask in the glow of infinite health, infinite currency and infinity itself.
Feel free to use the techniques that I describe below at your own risk, I don&amp;rsquo;t advise cheating in any game that is a live service, is online in any way, has leaderboards or has micro-transactions.</description></item><item><title>A Gamer's Guide to: Online Multiplayer</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-22/</guid><description>Welcome to my first &amp;ldquo;A Gamer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to…&amp;rdquo;. This series of articles will cover a wide range of topics of interest to gamers from the perspective of a video game programmer.
I know a little about what goes into making a video game. I gained a wide breadth of knowledge of every part of a video game including game engines, physics, gameplay, audio, AI, C++ (shiver) and more in my studies.</description></item><item><title>You can always reload, until you can't</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-08-16/</guid><description>Most games don&amp;rsquo;t matter. The actions you play out within most games don&amp;rsquo;t have any long term impact on you as a player. Some narrative games imply that the choices you make have an impact on the world but given that the world is imaginary, does it really matter? Some RPGs force you into making decisions that change the world or your characters but&amp;hellip; You can always press F8 and reload.</description></item><item><title>Interviews - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-06-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-06-26/</guid><description>Looking for a job sucks. A couple of months ago, I was going through interview after interview like a wrecking ball blasting through concrete. No buildings were destroyed in the process but I may have burned some bridges along the way. We laughed, we cried, it was roller coaster of emotions and then I got a job.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a blow-by-blow review of the interviews I went through. I&amp;rsquo;ve reflected on each interview and coupled each with recommendations for you if you are or are planning to go through a similar interview process.</description></item><item><title>My Game of the Year List for 2019</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-01-17/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2020-01-17/</guid><description>I love video games. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved them almost my entire life. I loved them enough to make making them my job. I&amp;rsquo;m not working in video game development anymore but I still enjoy playing games and pondering over them.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the video games I played in 2019 which I enjoyed the most (in no particular order).
Trials Rising ¶ Here&amp;rsquo;s my video review of Trials Rising which I wrote and recorded earlier this year during my extended break from employment (don&amp;rsquo;t expect any more reviews to come where that came from).</description></item><item><title>Warhammer 40k - a Blast from the Past</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-08-28/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-08-28/</guid><description>I recently dove head first into the world of Warhammer 40k. A dark and edgy tabletop game born in the 80s played with many miniature models of science fiction soldiers, aliens, etc.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of space orks (generic fantasy orcs thrust forty thousand years into the future) who paint their ships red because it makes them go faster (their belief makes it so) or about an immortal Emperor sending genetically modified soldiers all over the universe to defeat the forces of Chaos then that&amp;rsquo;s Warhammer 40k.</description></item><item><title>I code review an 8 year old project</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-12/</guid><description>One of the first projects I worked on after learning how to program, around 8 years ago, is called writerator. It is a Python command line interface (or CLI for short) for analyzing English language text and generating randomized poetry such as haikus and poems. I was contemplating using it to build a new side project which would analyze text from all over the internet from the previous day (news articles, Twitter posts, etc.</description></item><item><title>Building a website for 17$ or less</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-08/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-06-08/</guid><description>The website you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on was built by myself and it cost me a total of 17$ CDN (yearly). Without a custom domain it would have cost me nothing, zilch, nada.
My goal for this website was to create my own space on the internet to allow me to easily share the software engineering work I&amp;rsquo;ve done, share the writing I do on video games and encourage me to write about other topics that interest me.</description></item><item><title>Influencing the odds inside and outside of Blood Bowl 2</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-05-07/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-05-07/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Blood Bowl 2 smashes Warhammer and American football together, in an explosive cocktail of turn-based strategy, humour and brutality, adapted from Games Workshop&amp;rsquo;s famous board game.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to come up with a better brief description of what Blood Bowl is.
In Blood Bowl, you take on the role of a coach leading and managing a team playing an extremely violent mockery of American football. During a match, two teams try to carry one ball from one end of the pitch to the other but the similarities between football and Blood Bowl end there.</description></item><item><title>The website, Mortal Kombat 11 and microtransactions</title><link>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-04-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/blog/2019-04-24/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on my website (the one you&amp;rsquo;re currently on, I should probably put a &amp;ldquo;work-in-progress&amp;rdquo; sign up&amp;hellip;). Work has been going well so far. I had done most of the &amp;lsquo;setting everything up&amp;rsquo; for the site a year and a half ago before I was employed by Framestore VR.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently begun working on the project again, and the work has been going according to plan. I was expecting to spend the whole day working on on the website yesterday however Mortal Kombat 11&amp;rsquo;s story mode and juicy gameplay got in the way.</description></item></channel></rss>
