Ostracised from the Academy for my &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; research, I took to the streets where my ability to make things go boom would be put to good use.</p><p>We couldn&rsquo;t rely on Preacher to communicate with the Eye for us anymore. He hasn&rsquo;t been the same ever since he lost himself in the ghost field a few weeks back.</p><p>Always looking to prove herself and to gain the respect of her peers (and eventually the people of Doskvol), Teddy reached out to the Eye and the Eye reached back.</p><p>It was hungry and it wanted to be fed.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey guys, what can I get you?&rdquo;, said Chansey, the lovely bartender of the Bull, our usual haunt.</p><p>If everything went according to plan tonight, this would be her last day on the job.</p><p>As my colleagues drank the &ldquo;Teddy&rdquo; cocktails the bartender had whipped up for us to celebrate this special day, I fingered through my equipment, itching to get the real party started.</p><p>We stayed until closing time and waited just outside the bar for the right time to strike. We were regulars so it didn&rsquo;t take much convincing to get the bouncers off our ass.</p><p>As they walked away, I barrelled through Teddy, who should have known better than to try and get in my way, and kicked in the front door to the bar.</p><p>What I saw was&mldr; unexpected.</p><p>Chansey was flanked on all sides by another group of thugs, they must have came in through the back&mldr; Seeing this, Teddy quickly convinced the bouncers to attack Chansey&rsquo;s assailants instead of us while I started to do what I do best.</p><p>Many explosions, stabbings and fists to the jaw later, we were the last ones standing. Well almost, Desmond was knocked out and Teddy and I were barely keeping everything together.</p><p>But, everyone else in the bar was knocked out or dead.</p><p>On closer inspection, Chansey&rsquo;s attackers seemed to be members of the Circle of Flame. I hate to say it but&mldr; one of them got away. That&rsquo;ll be a problem for us to deal with another day.</p><p>We searched the bar for Chansey but we couldn&rsquo;t find her&mldr; A consolation prize will have to do, I chucked a barely breathing member of the Circle of Flame into the trunk as well as Desmond&rsquo;s hobo friend Steve, completely smashed out of his mind.</p><p>As I got into the driver&rsquo;s seat, I could see Chansey&rsquo;s massive boyfriend Giles roll up on us.</p><p>I told him that we weren&rsquo;t responsible for starting the fight in the bar (although under different circumstances we definitely would have been) and that Chansey was doing just fine&mldr; somewhere&mldr; probably.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t convinced.</p><p>Well, too bad. I started the engine and slammed on the pedal to get the hell out of there before the crows showed up.</p><p>Arriving back at the mine, I chucked the body and the soon-to-be body down the mine shaft for the Eye to consume, and I drove my unconscious colleagues back to my place for some well-deserved rest, despite our wickedness.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action>Follow me with fraidycat, or an RSS reader, to be notified whenever I write
