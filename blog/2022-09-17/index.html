I&rsquo;ve spent a long time just going through the motions. Living my life through the path of least resistance.</p><p>The world is ending and we&rsquo;re all going to die but the question is: what are we going to do in the meantime and why?</p><p>Sometime in 2021, I decided that, above all else, I want to avoid a slow death. I don&rsquo;t want to live an unexamined life where I constantly obliterate my consciousness through video games and just do what I&rsquo;ve always done.</p><p>Change is difficult, perhaps more difficult for me than most. But, change is something I strive for now more than ever before. I don&rsquo;t want to be the same person I was yesterday. Every day I&rsquo;m alive is an opportunity for growth and for new experiences.</p><p>New experiences are harder to come by these days but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t try.</p><p>The elevator in the building I live in broke down recently. There&rsquo;s quite a few older people with reduced mobility living here, so I wrote a letter and posted it up offering to help anyone to get their groceries to their unit. Imagine being in your 70s with a cane trying to get your groceries to the 7th floor without an elevator, it&rsquo;s not happening.</p><p>Past me might have not even understood that was something that I should do (I&rsquo;ve spent a long time being pretty clueless).</p><p>Thankfully, today&rsquo;s me was able to realize that I&rsquo;m physically capable and I like helping people so I might as offer to help people move some heavy stuff around.</p><p>In doing so, I was able to meet an older gentleman in my building who is absolutely amazing. A big nerd like me who&rsquo;s led a life that I can only dream of.</p><p>If I hadn&rsquo;t offered to help out with this broken elevator situation, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ever met him and that would be very sad.</p><p>Avoiding a slow death is a challenge because it seems that the world we live in today has been shaped to encourage us to live &ldquo;slow deaths&rdquo; in our little cramped cubes with despair, pain and fear being injected straight into our brains through the little black boxes we carry around with us everywhere.</p><p>But, even if it&rsquo;s hard, even it requires everything from me, I need to fight the slow death. I need to fight the urges programmed into my brain without my consent by a system built by the people in power who don&rsquo;t give a fuck about me (I&rsquo;m glad the Queen is dead btw, fuck her and all she stands for).</p><p>It would be easier to give up. To decide that I am powerless in the face of a series of overwhelming obstacles whether present in my psyche or the world outside of my own head.</p><p>Even if there&rsquo;s no hope, the moment you let hope die is the moment you die.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to die. Not now, not ever, but it&rsquo;s going to happen eventually. The timer is ticking, how will you choose to live your life and why?</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2023-01-02/>◀️GOTY List 2022</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-16/>▶️10 reasons why I'm in love with bouldering</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent blog posts</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2024-04-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>What's Up Gamers</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2023-01-02/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>GOTY List 2022</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-09-16/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>10 reasons why I'm in love with bouldering</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-22/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Tabletop Roleplaying: Getting your players to care</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-17/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>On Being Awesome (1)</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 58 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/books/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-light">
