You might think that this would lead to a lot of stalemates and just waiting around but not really because you&rsquo;re discouraged from staying in one spot for too long. Spread across the map are telephones that you can use to make the enemy sniper(s) visible to you on the map temporarily.</li><li>Playing as the Nazi sniper is a completely different experience than playing as the Allied snipers. Your fellow Nazi soldiers don&rsquo;t shoot you on sight (for obvious reasons) and so this allows you to navigate through your own territory much more comfortably than the Allied snipers can.</li><li>The telephones scattered throughout the map can be used by the Allied snipers immediately when the invasion starts to locate the enemy sniper but the Nazi sniper must wait 5min before using the telephones to do the same. This tips the scales in favor of the Allied snipers to counterbalance the Nazi sniper&rsquo;s ability to walk around the map as they please.</li><li>The Allied snipers have no way of differentiating the human Nazi sniper from other AI-controlled Nazi soldiers at first glance. But, through careful observation they can figure out who the human sniper is and take them out without them ever getting a chance to retaliate. Through the use of the binoculars, the Allied snipers are able to tag the Nazi sniper to track their location more easily and, by doing so, will discover if the soldier they&rsquo;ve tagged is controlled by a human player or not. However when a human player is tagged by another player they are notified of this and can thus make a swift retreat if you give them a chance too.</li><li>This asymmetry and hiding in plain sight reminds me a lot of <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/329070/SpyParty/>Spy Party</a> which is a great thing because Spy Party is one of my favorite games of all time. Anything that can come close to reminding me of it is a winner in my book.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve only played a few hours, beaten 1 mission, gotten most of the way through a 2nd and played 1 round as the Nazi sniper. But in that short amount of time, Sniper Elite 5 was able to really show me a good time and I&rsquo;m excited to get back into it for some more fun soon.</li><li>It&rsquo;s on Xbox Game Pass for the sweet sweet price of 1$ a month (for your first month, just remember to cancel it and sign up later for another month of access to a bunch of mediocre games and some good ones priced at 1$/month). If you&rsquo;ve got a friend to play with then you have no reason to miss out on this experience.</li></ul><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action><a href=https://fraidyc.at>Follow me with fraidycat</a>, or an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS>RSS reader</a>, to be notified whenever I write something.</blockquote></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-08/>◀️Human-Flavored Soup: Soup-Flavored Human</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-26/>▶️Five Reasons to build your website with Hugo</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent blog posts</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-11/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Got to Go Fast</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-10/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Sentient Potatoes: The Future of War</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-09/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>The Poltergeist Salad Tossed Itself</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-08-08/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Human-Flavored Soup: Soup-Flavored Human</li></a><a href=https://strategineer.com/blog/2022-05-26/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Five Reasons to build your website with Hugo</li></a><li class=footer-shortlist-archive><a href=/blog>... with 51 more in the archive</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-labelledby=offcanvasBottomLabel><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><div class=btn-toolbar role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button type=button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-dark">
