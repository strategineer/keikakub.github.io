          <p>Moving out of my childhood home to live on my own was tough. I realized this as I rolled out of the U-Haul truck with a piece of toast in one hand and my hopes and dreams in the other.</p>

<p>I moved out of my family's place a little more than a year ago. In the time since, I've experienced a lot, I've learned and I've grown. Given that I've just moved out again to somewhere new, I think it's appropriate to reflect on the time that I spent living away from my home and share that with you.</p>

<p>I've yet to find my Forever Partner, and I'm currently facing the real possibility that I will be Forever Alone. Our world's future is bleak enough that I don't see the need to bring new life into a soon to be dead world. If you're not interested in having kids then why have a long term romantic relationship in the first place?</p>

<p>To abide by social norms? That ain't me.</p>

<p>So here I am, living on my own. Being alone sucks. But being alone is also an opportunity for me to grow. Now, I'm fully responsible for everything in my life and so I need to rise up to challenges that present themselves or sink.</p>

<p>That's what I've tried to do. In the past year, I've become a healthier version of myself, physically and mentally.</p>

<p>For a couple months before moving out, I was neglecting my commitment to regular physical activity. Soon after moving out, I took it upon myself to get into strength training. It's been almost a year now. Unfortunately, I'm not big and green, yet, but I'm stronger than ever before.</p>

<p>I also took up intermittent fasting as a way of losing some weight. I've learned to cook for myself efficiently and well. And, as a result of all these changes, I feel better about myself than I ever have before.</p>

<p>It might surprise you to know that the biggest change for me has come from time and space away from my family. I love my family but I don't want to live with them again. I wasn't happy there, and that unhappiness leaked out into every facet of my life.</p>

<p>I wasn't fun to be around, I wasn't a good friend, I was negligent and the only thing I could to fix myself was to leave.</p>

<p>So I did.</p>

<p>As time passed, I've gradually shed the pain of my past life and have dedicated myself to becoming a better person every day. Perfection is unattainable but as long as I'm moving toward it I'm happy.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way that nobody is going to want to be around me if I'm not happy with myself and my life. I've learned to be satisfied with what I can't change while actively working to change what I can.</p>

<p>I've learned to be content with what I have, to appreciate my friends, to enjoy my job for what is, to love my family despite their imperfections… Is everything perfect? No. And that's OK.</p>

<p>I'm only human after all, I can't fix our broken world. But I can try my best to be happy and share that happiness with others in order to make our world suck just tiny bit less.</p>
