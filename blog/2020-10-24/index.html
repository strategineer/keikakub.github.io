I realized this as I rolled out of the U-Haul truck with a piece of toast in one hand and my hopes and dreams in the other.</p><p>I moved out of my family&rsquo;s place a little more than a year ago. In the time since, I&rsquo;ve experienced a lot, I&rsquo;ve learned and I&rsquo;ve grown. Given that I&rsquo;ve just moved out again somewhere new, why not reflect on the time that I spent living away from my family and share that with you.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve yet to find my partner in crime, and I&rsquo;m facing the possibility that I will be alone forever. Our world&rsquo;s future is bleak enough that I don&rsquo;t see the need to bring new life into a soon to be dead world. If you&rsquo;re not interested in having kids then why have a long term romantic relationship in the first place? To abide by social norms? That ain&rsquo;t me.</p><p>So here I am, living on my own. Being alone sucks but it&rsquo;s also an opportunity for me to grow. Now, I&rsquo;m fully responsible for everything in my life and so I need to rise up to challenges that present themselves or sink.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve tried to do. In the past year, I&rsquo;ve become a healthier version of myself, physically and mentally. For a couple months before moving out, I was neglecting my commitment to regular physical activity. After moving out, I took it upon myself to get into strength training and I&rsquo;ve been doing it ever since. I&rsquo;m not big and green, yet, but I&rsquo;m stronger than ever before. I took up intermittent fasting as a way of losing some weight. I&rsquo;ve learned to cook for myself efficiently and well. And, because of all this, I feel better about myself than I ever have before.</p><p>It might surprise you to know that the biggest change for me came from the time and space away from my family. I love my family but I don&rsquo;t want to live with them again. I wasn&rsquo;t happy there, and that unhappiness leaked out into every facet of my life. I wasn&rsquo;t fun to be around, I wasn&rsquo;t a good friend, I was negligent and the only thing I could do to fix myself was to leave.</p><p>So I did.</p><p>As time passed, I&rsquo;ve gradually shed the pain of my past life and have dedicated myself to becoming a better person every day. Perfection is unattainable but as long as I&rsquo;m moving toward it I&rsquo;m happy.</p><p>I learned the hard way that nobody is going to want to be around me if I&rsquo;m not happy with myself and my life. I&rsquo;ve learned to be content with what I can&rsquo;t change while working to change what I can.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be satisfied with what I have, to appreciate my friends, to enjoy my job for what is, to love my family despite their imperfections&mldr; Is everything perfect? No. And that&rsquo;s OK.</p><p>I&rsquo;m only human after all, I can&rsquo;t fix our broken world. But I can try my best to be happy and share that happiness with others to make our world suck just tiny bit less.</p><blockquote class=blog-call-to-action>None of the art/writing on this site was created using LLMs.<hr>If you'd like to get in touch with me, check out my <a href=/#contact-info>about page</a>.<hr>Follow me with an <a href=https://fraidyc.at/>RSS reader</a> to be notified when I write
