&lt;li>1 super hot fire map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>insane music (doesn&amp;rsquo;t loop properly though)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cool visuals + combat encounters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>colour palette&lt;/li>
&lt;li>solid AF&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Wads like this are convincing me that if you&amp;rsquo;ve got great music and shift the colour palette slightly combined with good level/combat encounter design, you&amp;rsquo;re golden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Machete</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/rl2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/rl2/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>Those scum ridden sacks of shit didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the empathy to honorably discharge me. I was just told to shut up and get out. I cleared a tech base of those nightmares and I bet they&amp;rsquo;d still rather see me dead than holding a place in the marines again. I don&amp;rsquo;t need help, I just need to wipe out the rest of these terrors and get rid of that awful noise. Onward to Sunveil Starport.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nostalgic Entropy: Neo Retro</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/ne/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/ne/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>jaw dropping visuals, custom textures, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>amazing music&lt;/li>

 &lt;p>&lt;p>Unluckily, you&amp;rsquo;ve spawned right in the midst of a trap. The demons have already made it to Earth. It seems like you have just two options of atonement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save Earth or die trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>

&lt;li>a megamad made by one person of 5 years, and it feels like it for better or worse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>music is a little &amp;ldquo;coffebreak&amp;rdquo; a little elevator music, lacks the propulsive or mystical quality that I&amp;rsquo;m usually looking for.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first few maps are serviceable and interesting but lack a certain jenesaisquoi. These were created first in the author&amp;rsquo;s DOOM mapping journey, so this makes sense. They&amp;rsquo;ve been touched up after the fact so they&amp;rsquo;re not horrible but they&amp;rsquo;re just OK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Music gets better after the first 1/3 (map12 track pretty great).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13: mall center, now we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo;, solid mapping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>14: the music gets kicking here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>15: back to low fi beat to kill demons to, not my favorite&lt;/li>
&lt;li>16: music kicks in exactly at the halfway point&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Fallen Leaves</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/fallenleaves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/fallenleaves/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>great start, great music, tight combat, awesome color palette&lt;/li>
&lt;li>short and sweet, high polish&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>What Lies Beneath</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/whatlies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/whatlies/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gothic horror, moody, starts off entering a spooky mansion and descending into the dungeon&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sort of like wad where you go up an elevator in a skyscraper but reversed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>vibes on point, gameplay not as tight, feels a little random enemy spawn-wise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>great music&lt;/li>
&lt;li>lack of consistency in vision and game mechanics and progression of ideas&amp;hellip;, too many cooks, but each level has a lot of love put into it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map4 blacksite: sick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I think I&amp;rsquo;d take a group of less interesting less good maps that are thematically vibewise and gameplay wise cohesive than hodge podge of better maps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map8: where fools always trespass, elevator sequence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>really too hodge podgy mix and match, lack of cohesion, but the highs are high. not my preference but very cool levels in here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map11: falling platforms section&lt;/li>
&lt;li>last map might be a little too big&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Whispers Of Satan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/wos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/wos/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>collab between pcorf and Aro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of &amp;ldquo;causing&amp;rdquo; it. Now here&amp;rsquo;s a Doom map that&amp;rsquo;s explicitly about going into a &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; and blasting through hordes of &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo;. The music hits here, it&amp;rsquo;s melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>very tight ammo setup (tightest I&amp;rsquo;ve played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)&lt;/li>

 &lt;p>After 12,000 linedefs of action, you have won this battle and have destroyed the source of this demonic civilization. Condemnation is no more and the mystery of this pandemic has finally been solved. As you hop onto the derelict imperial space station Ondor (sic) for the long journey back home you destroy the rest of these beasts with ease blasting them to oblivion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
