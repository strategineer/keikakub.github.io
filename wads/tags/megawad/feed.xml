&lt;li>inspired by Going Down (mouldy)? The first track is by him and the concept seems related. AshtralFiend&amp;rsquo;s participation in this collab would make sense if that&amp;rsquo;s the case because mouldy&amp;rsquo;s work seems related to his generally.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Going Up?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tiny maps (1024x1024)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>these tiny maps really fit with most of what AshtralFiend has worked on so far, they seem fascinated by tiny tight maps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr07: tight wave-based arena fight, feels pretty good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of doomcute&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr15: using single skull next to doors to show that following this path will give you the appropriate skull/key, something to do myself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr22: AshtralFiend feels like a main character in this community project, his maps stand out. This one is kind of wild, finally walking around the tower and being able to fall all the way down.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>some of these later maps are atrocious&lt;/li>
&lt;li>flr35: wild set piece&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Eviternity II</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/eviternity2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/eviternity2/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I loved the first Eviternity, let&amp;rsquo;s see how this holds up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nice palette&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map01
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>crazy intro teleporter thing, let&amp;rsquo;s check this in doombuilder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>also revisiting levels from the first megawad but altered due to doomguy&amp;rsquo;s efforts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>jump pads still kind of wild, although a little glitchy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map02
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>first button you hit, you see exactly what it activates in LOS&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cool rain effect&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map03
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>leaves falling effect, cool&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>making the pistol fire faster is a classic great way of fixing the pistol feeling awful to use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>each map&amp;rsquo;s exit allow you to see the start of the next map is brilliant
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a lot of &amp;ldquo;high budget&amp;rdquo; choices like this bring this wad above and beyond others&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the detailing in every room is just insane&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>having a switch bring up some stairs with a switch on them allowing the player to &amp;ldquo;unlock&amp;rdquo; being able to activate these stairs up and down to access new areas seems key (not something new but something I was having trouble coming up with on my own during my most recent mapping session)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>also, having really big stairs have a dedicated button next to them instead of on them&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map05 track is cool but doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>breadcrumb rocket ammo, encourages keeping your eyes peeled and makes the movement funner than it would be otherwise (like coins in Mario)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map07: big open space with monsters all around, open this one up in UDB and take a look at how this works.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>two SSG spawns on both ends of the map to increases the chances of the player picking it up sooner rather than later. Especially once the pinkies are start showing up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>every enemy set to ambush probably. Ample use of cacos that can fly over obstacles and threaten the player. A lot of weak monsters out of reach that the player can ping with the chaingun, big bads are very rarely out of reach. Arachnotron used as a turret though&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hit a switch and different monster comps teleported into the arena you just fought in&lt;/li>
&lt;li>switches / combined with walk over linedef actions to force player to walk back and forth while fighting enemies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>masterful use of colours to guide the player towards buttons they can press or should press based on the keys they have (map06 does this too)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>grey arachnos are deadly but their shots can be avoided with movement so they encourage you to keep moving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>giving an extra rocket launcher as well, just in case&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of sector manipulation to create arenas where fights happen then eventually the arena opens back up again. Check how this is done in UDB&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map09: nice&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map11: constantly expanding arena with new monsters&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map12: another map with an expanding arena, a bunch of imps teleporting in, seems like the imp is the go to spammable enemy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map14: wild puzzles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map16: callback to eviternity map01?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map17: cool shifting stage and teleporting probably&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map20: another map ending on a locked in arena fight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map21: skidding on ice? ya&amp;hellip; not sure I like this gimmick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map22: a &amp;ldquo;gauntlet&amp;rdquo; style map where you run through all of it, triggering a bunch of enemies and picking up weapons along the way&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map23: another &amp;ldquo;gauntlet&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>where are the keys?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map24: another gauntlet, is this very skillsaw-inspired?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>wild arena fight after you get all the keys, tight room&lt;/li>
&lt;li>oh ok, we&amp;rsquo;re doing 3 big arena fight for each of the skull keys&lt;/li>
&lt;li>coolest map combat-wise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>god-tier doomcute battleship at the end&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map25: epic boss fight
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>fantastic track&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map26: like map01, more of an atmospheric level, something like ALT
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>spooky AF track&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map acts like a transition from one setting to another, emphasing the transition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shivers inducing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>BIG reveal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OK this map is not what I&amp;rsquo;m into, I need to play more slaughter maps and understand what make them tick for something like this to hit for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The laggyness despite playing on the best performance source port (DSDA-Doom) is rough&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OOHHHHHHH OK I get it now, beating puzzley sub-maps to make the main big fight easier wasn&amp;rsquo;t foreshadowed much and so I bulldozed my way into an actually absurd fight. Probably beatable but not fun playing the map that way. But this is a really cool premise&lt;/li>
&lt;li>but that&amp;rsquo;s a really cool concept now that I know WTF is going on here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>haunting&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cringe compilation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>closing thoughts:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whispers Of Satan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/wos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/wos/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>collab between pcorf and Aro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fantastic original midi soundtrack, with both pcorf and Aro being talented musicians&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map9: the school, a no russian-esque map, an explicit reference to columbine? That massacre directly led to Doom coming up in the news and being villified and being accused of &amp;ldquo;causing&amp;rdquo; it. Now here&amp;rsquo;s a Doom map that&amp;rsquo;s explicitly about going into a &amp;ldquo;school&amp;rdquo; and blasting through hordes of &amp;ldquo;demons&amp;rdquo;. The music hits here, it&amp;rsquo;s melancholic and it feels like it represents the loss of innocence.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>very tight ammo setup (tightest I&amp;rsquo;ve played recently, every bullet is essential, waste is lethal)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of time spent with the shotgun, smashing your head against bullet sponges. Enemy composition choices are questionable at times, it seems like the mappers were more interested in creating a hopeless vibe instead of purely &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; gameplay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maps get super long past the 1/2 mark&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map25: sneaky cyberdemon teleporting around ominously, very cool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ubiquitous crosses, inverted, normal, orthodox, but just generally there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of indented decoration in walls. It&amp;rsquo;s used a little too much maybe but it does provide the dozen maps of the wad with a unique look/feel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map26: organ music at start, great vibes for the evil cathedral setting of the map&lt;/li>
&lt;li>too long, overstays its welcome because the combat isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; enough to hold the rest of it up?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this has some really iconic set pieces / scenes (map30: hell-levator) but they&amp;rsquo;re spread a little because the maps are so long&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ammo counts a little sus, even when making full use of chainsaw / berserk punching, you just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough. Although I can get a little better at punching demons&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Atonement</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/atone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/atone/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>&lt;p>Unluckily, you&amp;rsquo;ve spawned right in the midst of a trap. The demons have already made it to Earth. It seems like you have just two options of atonement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Save Earth or die trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a megamad made by one person of 5 years, and it feels like it for better or worse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>music is a little &amp;ldquo;coffebreak&amp;rdquo; a little elevator music, lacks the propulsive or mystical quality that I&amp;rsquo;m usually looking for.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first few maps are serviceable and interesting but lack a certain jenesaisquoi. These were created first in the author&amp;rsquo;s DOOM mapping journey, so this makes sense. They&amp;rsquo;ve been touched up after the fact so they&amp;rsquo;re not horrible but they&amp;rsquo;re just OK.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Music gets better after the first 1/3 (map12 track pretty great).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>13: mall center, now we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo;, solid mapping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>14: the music gets kicking here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>15: back to low fi beat to kill demons to, not my favorite&lt;/li>
&lt;li>16: music kicks in exactly at the halfway point&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Zone 400</title><link>https://strategineer.com/wads/zone400/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/wads/zone400/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>After 12,000 linedefs of action, you have won this battle and have destroyed the source of this demonic civilization. Condemnation is no more and the mystery of this pandemic has finally been solved. As you hop onto the derelict imperial space station Ondor (sic) for the long journey back home you destroy the rest of these beasts with ease blasting them to oblivion.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>400 line defs each megawad by one mapper (pcorf)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mostly consistent map length feels good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>economy of design, reusing the same spaces over and over again. A little bit of difficulty in differentiating the levels. There&amp;rsquo;s an intentional use of different textures-sets throughout but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to really make these maps feel really different.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>gradual expansion of arenas and combination of them as more monster closets are revealed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip; I like this more than I would have expected.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of random TPs used to move enemies around the arenas&amp;hellip; interesting but hard to parse. Makes the maps feel a little random. It feels like a bandaid to solve the problem of wanting to have these maps be tiny but re-use the existing spaces a bunch&amp;hellip; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>map11: great example of this idea of opening an arena gradually&lt;/li>
&lt;li>timed buttons keep the pace up but sometimes slow you down when you miss the timing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>singular/low rocket ammo drops, forces tactical rocket use more than usual&lt;/li>
&lt;li>maps separated into mostly thematic episodes with different map design ethos/pillars in each it feels like&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2020 pandemic-inspired story line&lt;/li>

 &lt;p>Those scum ridden sacks of shit didn&amp;rsquo;t even have the empathy to honorably discharge me. I was just told to shut up and get out. I cleared a tech base of those nightmares and I bet they&amp;rsquo;d still rather see me dead than holding a place in the marines again. I don&amp;rsquo;t need help, I just need to wipe out the rest of these terrors and get rid of that awful noise. Onward to Sunveil Starport.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
