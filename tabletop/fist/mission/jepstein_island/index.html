      Our client for this job has tipped us off that BOOTY, you know those pirates and elder god worshipping cultists?, are planning on taking over Effrey Jepstein&rsquo;s private island in the middle of the Caribbean during his next big party he&rsquo;s throwing and performing one of their rituals to appease their god. That&rsquo;s kind of their thing, we&rsquo;re not too worried about it.
Our client wants to us to send some agents, that&rsquo;s you, over to the island while the attack is happening using it as cover to, huh, let&rsquo;s just say, &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; some of the high tech gadgets that Jepstein has collected over the years and, conveniently for us, placed all over his island.
Jepstein&rsquo;s private island parties can get quite hectic, you never know who might be attending. You should expect the BOOTY pirates to put up quite a fight and if you run into any members of Jepstein&rsquo;s Security force, you might be able to convince them that you&rsquo;re there to help (and get their help in return), just don&rsquo;t try to steal, cough, sorry &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; any gadgets while they&rsquo;re looking.
