      A week ago the R&amp;D team at IRIS, you know the guys who are really into that ancient Egyptian shit, found the tomb of Amushpet IV which they&rsquo;ve been looking for forever.
Soon after, IRIS established a base of operations outside entrance to the tomb and they&rsquo;ve been exploring and cataloguing their finds since then (clay tablets, jewels, gold, you know things you&rsquo;d find in a tomb).
Problem is&mldr; IRIS HQ lost contact with their people at the base this morning and so they&rsquo;ve contracted us to go to the tomb and find out what happened and see if anything can be salvaged.
Whenever IRIS sets up an on-site base like this, they set up a barrier to prevent signals from coming into or out of the site. But on-site crew are expected to communicate back to HQ with their progress using the carefully monitored GPS phone, usually with a spare on-site, that can send and receive signals through the barrier.
Maybe their phone&rsquo;s broken and they misplaced the spare? Whatever the case may be, you&rsquo;ll need to get on-site and make contact with the head IRIS researcher, codenamed Brainiac, and figure out what&rsquo;s going over there.
