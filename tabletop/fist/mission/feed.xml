 &lt;p>&lt;p>A week ago the R&amp;amp;D team at IRIS, you know the guys who are really into that ancient Egyptian shit, found the tomb of Amushpet IV which they&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after, IRIS established a base of operations outside entrance to the tomb and they&amp;rsquo;ve been exploring and cataloguing their finds since then (clay tablets, jewels, gold, you know &lt;em>things you&amp;rsquo;d find in a tomb&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Problem is&amp;hellip; IRIS HQ lost contact with their people at the base this morning and so they&amp;rsquo;ve contracted us to go to the tomb and find out what happened and see if anything can be salvaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever IRIS sets up an on-site base like this, they set up a barrier to prevent signals from coming into or out of the site. But on-site crew are expected to communicate back to HQ with their progress using the carefully monitored GPS phone, usually with a spare on-site, that can send and receive signals through the barrier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe their phone&amp;rsquo;s broken and they misplaced the spare? Whatever the case may be, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get on-site and make contact with the head IRIS researcher, codenamed Brainiac, and figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going over there.&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>

 &lt;p>&lt;p>Our client for this job has tipped us off that BOOTY, you know those pirates and elder god worshipping cultists?, are planning on taking over Effrey Jepstein&amp;rsquo;s private island in the middle of the Caribbean during his next big party he&amp;rsquo;s throwing and performing one of their rituals to appease their god. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of their thing, we&amp;rsquo;re not too worried about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our client wants to us to send some agents, that&amp;rsquo;s you, over to the island while the attack is happening using it as cover to, huh, let&amp;rsquo;s just say, &amp;ldquo;acquire&amp;rdquo; some of the high tech gadgets that Jepstein has collected over the years and, conveniently for us, placed all over his island.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jepstein&amp;rsquo;s private island parties can get quite hectic, you never know who might be attending. You should expect the BOOTY pirates to up quite a fight and if you run into any members of Jepstein&amp;rsquo;s Security force, you might be able to convince them that you&amp;rsquo;re there to help (and get their help in return), just don&amp;rsquo;t try to steal, cough, sorry &amp;ldquo;acquire&amp;rdquo; any gadgets while they&amp;rsquo;re looking.&lt;/p>

 &lt;p>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve got a client who&amp;rsquo;s requested that we send some agents, that&amp;rsquo;s you guys, to board a US Navy ship to recover or destroy the dangerous biological weapon that&amp;rsquo;s on board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This biological weapon&amp;rsquo;s name is Caesar. Large, green, scaley, shoots lasers out of its eyes (that kind of thing). Caesar was discovered in the vicinity of Pompeii by a Prof. Ivan Gotrovitch, a Soviet national. He sold both his discovery and his knowledge about Caesar and the rest of his kind to the American Navy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The USS Sherlock, with Caesar on board, is currently in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, en route to the U.S. West Coast. You&amp;rsquo;re tasked with getting on board the ship and recovering or destroying Caesar before they reach their destination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caesar is a once in a lifetime find and so expect to come into contact with forces other than the US Navy sailors on the ship.&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>FIST has been tasked with freeing or destroying a kaiju named Caesar. It is currently in a U.S. Navy ship â€“ the USS Sherlock. FIST must infiltrate the ship, and deal with the kaiju in any way they can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, the Yellowjackets squad has been tasked by CYCLOPS to recover the crowns used by prof. Gotrovitch to manipulate the creature!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FIST - Mission Template</title><link>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/template/</guid><description>&lt;p>[MISSION SUMMARY]&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FIST - One-Shot 1</title><link>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/oneshot1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/oneshot1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Notes for running the FIST Hazard Function funnel mission (ref: &lt;a href="https://itch.io/queue/c/2461905/compatible-with-fist?game_id=1684797">https://itch.io/queue/c/2461905/compatible-with-fist?game_id=1684797&lt;/a>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FIST - The Siege III - The Re-Siegening</title><link>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/the_siege/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/the_siege/</guid><description>&lt;p>Maps created by Tom Cartos &lt;a href="https://www.tomcartos.com/police-station">https://www.tomcartos.com/police-station&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
