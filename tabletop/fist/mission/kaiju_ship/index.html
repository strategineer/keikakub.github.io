      We&rsquo;ve got a client who&rsquo;s requested that we send some agents, that&rsquo;s you guys, to board a US Navy ship to recover or destroy the dangerous biological weapon that&rsquo;s on board.
This biological weapon&rsquo;s name is Caesar. Large, green, scaley, shoots lasers out of its eyes (that kind of thing). Caesar was discovered in the vicinity of Pompeii by a Prof. Ivan Gotrovitch, a Soviet national. He sold both his discovery and his knowledge about Caesar and the rest of his kind to the American Navy.
The USS Sherlock, with Caesar on board, is currently in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, en route to the U.S. West Coast. You&rsquo;re tasked with getting on board the ship and recovering or destroying Caesar before they reach their destination.
Caesar is a once in a lifetime find and so expect to come into contact with forces other than the US Navy sailors on the ship.

      
    
FIST has been tasked with freeing or destroying a kaiju named Caesar. It is currently in a U.S. Navy ship – the USS Sherlock. FIST must infiltrate the ship, and deal with the kaiju in any way they can.
At the same time, the Yellowjackets squad has been tasked by CYCLOPS to recover the crowns used by prof. Gotrovitch to manipulate the creature!..." property="og:description"><meta content="https://strategineer.com/tabletop/fist/mission/kaiju_ship/" property="og:url"><meta content="#43B581" data-react-helmet=true name=theme-color><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href="/apple-touch-icon.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href="/favicon-32x32.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href="/favicon-16x16.png?v=1"><link rel=manifest href="/site.webmanifest?v=1"><link rel=mask-icon href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=1" color=#5bbad5><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?v=1"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#da532c"><meta name=theme-color content="#ff0000"><meta name=description content="Author: strategineer, category: tabletop, description: "><link href="/css/site.min.b482754bd5842f0d8106c835b6248f9a551d66c067c35f2ab32cbf7361f1d62f.css" rel=stylesheet><title>FIST - Kaiju Ship</title></head><body id=documentTop><script type=text/javascript src=/js/rpg_table_randomizer.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/site_rpg.min.js></script><div class=container-fluid><div class="row no-margin justify-content-center"><div class=col-xl-2><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-left" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasLeft aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-10 main no-margin"><div class="row justify-content-center text-center page-title"><div class="col h1">FIST - Kaiju Ship</div></div><div class=readable><p>Heavily based on <a href=https://fayveline.itch.io/the-red-folder>https://fayveline.itch.io/the-red-folder</a></p><blockquote><p><p>We&rsquo;ve got a client who&rsquo;s requested that we send some agents, that&rsquo;s you guys, to board a US Navy ship to recover or destroy the dangerous biological weapon that&rsquo;s on board.</p><p>This biological weapon&rsquo;s name is Caesar.
