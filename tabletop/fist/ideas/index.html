The scrambler is thorough down to the userâs voice and mannerisms, but cannot simulate any existing person due to quantum interference.

This upgrade can be taken again to increase any squad attribute by 1, or to add a new squad. Squads can also be brought along on player missions as referee-controlled NPCs. When the players send a backup squad on a mission, the referee should choose an attribute score to represent the mission (e.g. FRC for wiping out an enemy group, RFX for stealth infiltration) and roll for the squad's performance: TWO 1s: The squad dies or (1-in-1D6) defects.

You might flesh out the area around the main objective to give them a better idea of how and where it exists spatially, or draw a quick map of a building and mark multiple entrances (like a front door, back door, and loading bay). In medias res openings can also work beautifully, as long as you still include a tactical element. âHow do we get out of here" is a reliable classic.</dd><dt>ESPIONAGE</dt><dd>Even the simplest âbug hunt" missions cannot exist in a vacuum without information or connected people. Figure out where in your mission info-social-focused players could thrive, and include things for them to interact with. This could mean writing up a few NPCs with clear motivations, assets, and liabilities. It could mean infosec challenges to be overcome, like figuring out passcodes or managing how dangerous information spreads. Before you think of things to shoot at, think of things to talk about.</dd><dt>ACTION</dt><dd>Last (but certainly not least), throw in catalyzing elements for action. Violence is the most obvious choice for action, and many players will jump at the possibility for violent action wherever it exists. The implicit threat of violence, or an imperative to avoid violence, can also be wonderful catalysts. You might deliciously complicate a mission by including a network of neural implants that lock down the entire facility if a soldier is harmed, have the players sneak past a sleeping monster, or rappel down a cliff to avoid being captured.</dd></dl></section><section id=ideas><h2>Ideas
