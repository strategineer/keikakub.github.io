BACKUP: FIST gets a backup squad of mercenaries who can be sent on missions in lieu of the players. This squad (p. 106) has a collective score of 0 in FRC, TAC, CRE, and RFX. This upgrade can be taken again to increase any squad attribute by 1, or to add a new squad. Squads can also be brought along on player missions as referee-controlled NPCs. When the players send a backup squad on a mission, the referee should choose an attribute score to represent the mission (e.g. FRC for wiping out an enemy group, RFX for stealth infiltration) and roll for the squad's performance: TWO 1s: The squad dies or (1-in-1D6) defects. FAILURE: The mission consequence plays out. PARTIAL: Mission complete, but no reward. SUCCESS: As above, but players get the reward. TWO 6s: As above, plus +1 to any squad attribute.","2. DEFENSE: FIST installs new security measures, such as squads of guards, hazards, or traps. For each DEFENSE upgrade installed, FIST may instantly kill one enemy near the upgrade during base invasions.","3. EXPERT: FIST hires an on-site expert who can provide the team with additional items before the mission begins. Experts in different fields offer different items: a weaponsmith may present the team with weapon tags, a scientist may create new chemical compounds, and a doctor may provide medical supplies. FIST can get one randomized item per expert per mission, or request a specific item and wait until the next mission begins to receive it.","4. OFFENSE: FIST acquires a weapon of mass destruction which can be used against a chosen target once per mission. Various weapon types are possible, but it should be something dangerous, like a bomber plane, orbital laser, or powerful ancient relic. FIST is also subject to this weapon and so must clear the area before its use, or risk being hurt as well. The weapon deals 3D6 DAMAGE by default, and taking OFFENSE again increases the DAMAGE by 1D6.","5. STORAGE: FIST builds a warehouse or hangar which can be used to safely store vehicles, hide fugitives, and contain anomalies without being detected.",'6. SUPPORT: FIST gains a “man-in-the-chair" style support agent who can contact them throughout their missions via radio. This support agent will reveal information the players would not usually be able to access when asked, according to their area of expertise: a weapons expert can divulge enemy DAMAGE ratings, a tactician can describe boss moves before they happen, etc. Sup'];function pickRandomlyFromTableBaseUpgrade(){let

<a href=#missions>¶</a></h1><dl><dt>TACTICS</dt><dd>Start here. The first decision players should be able to make is how to approach the mission, and they should enter the fold in a good spot to make a game plan. You might flesh out the area around the main objective to give them a better idea of how and where it exists spatially, or draw a quick map of a building and mark multiple entrances (like a front door, back door, and loading bay). In medias res openings can also work beautifully, as long as you still include a tactical element. “How do we get out of here" is a reliable classic.</dd><dt>ESPIONAGE</dt><dd>Even the simplest “bug hunt" missions cannot exist in a vacuum without information or connected people. Figure out where in your mission info-social-focused players could thrive, and include things for them to interact with. This could mean writing up a few NPCs with clear motivations, assets, and liabilities. It could mean infosec challenges to be overcome, like figuring out passcodes or managing how dangerous information spreads. Before you think of things to shoot at, think of things to talk about.</dd><dt>ACTION</dt><dd>Last (but certainly not least), throw in catalyzing elements for action. Violence is the most obvious choice for action, and many players will jump at the possibility for violent action wherever it exists. The implicit threat of violence, or an imperative to avoid violence, can also be wonderful catalysts. You might deliciously complicate a mission by including a network of neural implants that lock down the entire facility if a soldier is harmed, have the players sneak past a sleeping monster, or rappel down a cliff to avoid being captured.</dd></dl></section><section id=ideas><h2>Ideas
