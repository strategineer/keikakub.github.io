This is Jordan Cane, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of me from one of my many movies and my music [sounds of gunshots, explosions and Darude Sandstorm can be heard in the background]. I&rsquo;m in a bit of the situation here [shu shu (cocks shotgun)] at Effrey Jepstein&rsquo;s island retreat and I&rsquo;d pay you well to get over here and stop all this nonsense [pow pow (gunfire)] and get me out of here. Bye bye now.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Otakon Mission Briefing:</p><blockquote><p>(straight talker) &ldquo;Soooooo, you&rsquo;re heading over to Effrey Jepstein&rsquo;s private island to disrupt the BOOTY ritual, those pesky fishmen cultists pirates are at it again, trying to appease the elder god they worship, we can&rsquo;t let that happen. We&rsquo;ve got a high roller paying our bill this time, uhhh, so don&rsquo;t mess it up. Jepstein&rsquo;s got an impressive collection of high tech CYCLOPS gadgets on that island of his, if you can find them, take them, they don&rsquo;t belong to him&mldr; (whisper) Well they don&rsquo;t belong to us either but (speak louder) that&rsquo;s OK&mldr; And, if you can find Jordan Cane and extract him from the island that would be great, I just love his music&mldr; (singing offtune) I remembeeeerr everyyyything (cough).
