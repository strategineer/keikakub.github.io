You might be a group like Robin Hood and his Merry Men, or be more self-serving or just plain evil. A powerful mage asks you to steal a painting from a well guarded private collection. You accept and the job goes perfectly.</p><p>For some reason, he&rsquo;s requested that you hold on to the painting for a while and that you to hang it up in the abandoned warehouse you&rsquo;ve been using as a safehouse. As the moonlight shines through the broken windows, the scene depicted in the painting comes alive and beckons you to enter it. You venture into the unknown world in the painting, and quickly become obsessed with exploring it, each of you for reasons only you understand.</p><p>Will you find what you&rsquo;ve always been looking for in <em>The Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon</em>?</p><p><strong>What separates this campaign from others?</strong></p><ul><li>A focus on old school dungeon crawling. Think resource management, using your wits more often than your character abilities, encountering more rational NPCs/factions that you can interact with peacefully (usually) and less mindless monsters to slay.</li><li>An otherworldy setting with less fantasy tropes and more mythical high concept weird shit.</li><li>It&rsquo;s going to get weird and you&rsquo;re going to like it (I hope).</li></ul><p><strong>What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?</strong></p><ul><li>The pay for the job seemed a little too good to be true.</li><li>Paintings that &ldquo;pull&rdquo; you into them aren&rsquo;t normal, this is some magical shit.</li><li>Life is short and brutal. You&rsquo;re lucky to have survived this long.</li><li><em>The Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon</em> is compelling you to explore it and you&rsquo;ll discover its secrets or die trying.</li></ul><p><strong>What characters work best in the campaign?</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;ll be using the Shadowdark RPG rules and classes. You can imagine that a group of Robin Hood-esque outlaws might have a fighter (some muscle), a thief (some stealth), a priest (some support), a wizard (some magic). But anything goes, play what you want and how you want!</p><p><strong>What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?</strong></p><p>The following list is not exhaustive but gives you a good idea: gore, depression, madness, death, suicide, unrequited love, creepy nightmare plants, invasive body horror, abusive relationships, parasitic seduction, gross undead babies.</p><p><strong>What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?</strong></p><p>The group will quickly find NPCs in the labyrinth who are willing to give them rewards in exchange for their services.</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/blog/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's blog" class="menu-button btn btn-lg btn-dark">
