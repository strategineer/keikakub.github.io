When creating PCs, each one must be linked another character in some way (siblings? childhood friends? colleagues?). Ideally, each should be able to describe one memorable moment that occurred between them.
PC death timers (1d4 + CON modifier rounds, min. 1), are kept secret by the GM from all players until another PC checks their pulse or tries to heal or stabilize them.
Luck tokens are lost if not used at the end of every session. However, players can gain a luck token for the next session by providing the GM with their feedback for the session in the form of Stars and Wishes at the end of each session.

<a href=#stars-and-wishes>¶</a></h2><p><strong>Stars</strong> are simple: Every involved person shall point to one item, person, or incident that they really enjoyed during the session. It could be &ldquo;I really loved how you portrayed that Rat-Chaos-Mutant&rsquo;s speech, GM-Bob.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christy, your Barbarian was so cool when she burst through the door yelling bloody murder.&rdquo; Just name something that you really enjoyed.</p><p><strong>Wishes</strong> are not so simple: It&rsquo;s formulating about what you like to see in the future. But it should be constructive.</p><p>For example &ldquo;Please, no more zombies&rdquo; is not a valid wish. You need to formulate your wish in a positive light on how to make things better. The wish for different enemies should be formulated in a way to what you want to face, not just what you don&rsquo;t want to face. &ldquo;With all those zombies around, can we finally face the necromancer making them?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I think fighting a larger boss monster instead of just T-virus Zombies might be a nice change.&rdquo;</p><p>Wishes also allow asking changes that players can do or that were harming your fun in the game in a positive manner. &ldquo;Christy, could you try to not yell your battle cry into my ear next time you do your battle cry?&rdquo; At times it can be used to suggest things about things that affect the game but are not in the game entirely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like if you&rsquo;d drop a note if you are late in the future&rdquo; is a valid wish in this regard.</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/tabletop/lobg/intro/>◀️Intro</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/tabletop/lobg/ideas/>▶️Ideas</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div><div class="offcanvas show offcanvas-bottom" data-bs-scroll=true data-bs-backdrop=false tabindex=-1 id=offcanvasBottom aria-label="navigation bar"><div class=offcanvas-body><div class="menu-buttons row justify-content-center"><div class="col-auto btn-toolbar" role=toolbar aria-label="Main Toolbar"><div class="btn-group btn-group-lg"><a href=/><button tabindex=-1 type=button aria-label="Go to Strat's homepage" class="menu-button btn btn-lg btn-dark">
