The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine.

A creature with darkvision can&rsquo;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&rsquo;t illuminate it.</p><p>If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn&rsquo;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.</p><p>If any of this spell&rsquo;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p></section><section id=shrink><h4>Shrink

On a success, the spell has no effect.</p><p>If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.</p><p>Reduce. The target&rsquo;s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category&ndash;from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target&rsquo;s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target&rsquo;s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can&rsquo;t reduce the damage below 1).</p></section><section id=sleep><h4>Sleep

The caster chooses how many targets to affect &ndash; if they affect only 2, the creatures take a -1 penalty on the save, if they affect only 1, the creatures take a -2 penalty on the save. The spell can be undone with a heal, restoration, or wish cast specifically to dispel this effect.</p></section><section id=audible-glamer><h4>Audible Glamer
<a href=#audible-glamer>¶</a></h4><dl><dt>Duration</dt><dd>2 Rounds</dd><dt>Range</dt><dd>Close</dd></dl><p>The spell causes a sound to arise from a space within range, audible to any within the normal hearing range of the sound. This sound can be anything the caster desires, from talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, and running to a hoard of running rats to a roaring lion or a roaring dragon. The sound can be made to recede, approach, or remain fixed in place. Anyone hearing the sound who does not believe it can make a saving throw to hear no sound, or perhaps just a faint noise. The volume of sound is based on the level of the caster &ndash; the caster can produce a volume equal to four people per caster level (a hoard of rats is equal to 8 people, a roaring lion is equal to 16, and a roaring dragon is equal to 24 &ndash; the DM may base other sounds on this estimate).</p></section><section id=change-self><h4>Change Self
