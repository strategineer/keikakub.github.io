But she, will do anything to stop you.</p><p>Arcane sconces can be removed from the walls and taken with PCs. They provide light as torches and go out at the same time. They can be &ldquo;recharged&rdquo; by being placed back on the walls in this room.</p><p>If PCs in the prison look back at the painting on the south wall, and examine it carefully, they will see, in the shadows of the room they have just left, a small pale boy who was not there before, Tyko Wort. If anyone goes to him and takes his hand Tyko can transport them instantly to the room with red pillars (Wedding 173).</p></section><section id=ashen-chanterelle><h3>Ashen Chanterelle

Wants to escape her chains by any means (deceit, violence, charm, you name it) and go through the painting to the other world, taking the painting down and hiding it preventing anyone from following here.</p><p>The woman in chains is Ashen Chanterelle. Evil, abusive, deceptive and smart. All she wants is to escape into the moonlit room. She will tell PCs that freeing her will open the north door. She will devise any necessary lie. Her CHA is 18. Enchantments give false signals to those who perceive by magical means. She will pretend to be an innocent slave cursed to guard the Medusa’s Maze forever.</p></section><section id=halls-2><h2>Halls 2
