<a href=#intro>¶</a></h1><p>The default X-Mooks setting is Glogea (glow-gee-aaa). What follows are some notes on parts of it. They are far from exhaustive.</p><p>I plan on starting small, combining this setting with existing OSR modules and building things out on the fly. I want to focus on what&rsquo;s different/cool instead of regurgitating what&rsquo;s the same/boring.</p></section><section id=core><h1>Core
<a href=#core>¶</a></h1><p>What makes Glogea special compared to your generic fantasy setting? In Glogea, every being, humanoid or otherwise, is born with latent magical power of a particular kind (fire, time, gravity, esper, etc.) that always visibly manifest in some way on the being (whether through a physical appearance thing, a guardian spirit, a familiar or something else).</p><p>Most beings never access this power, but through study, guidance and/or luck a select few beings will manage to access their power.</p><p>The more powerful a being&rsquo;s power is the more visually distinct its manifestation is. It may also have effects on the being&rsquo;s behavior, their mind and their perception of the world around them.</p></section><section id=magic><h1>Magic
<a href=#magic>¶</a></h1><p>Spells are creatures that can be convinced to join your cause, think Pokémon.</p><p>When you&rsquo;re born, you&rsquo;re bound to a spell semi-permanently (there are always exceptions), called an innate spell, think X-Men but with magic.</p><p>Innate spells manifest visually:</p><ul><li>On your body (burning hand, translucent skin, etc.), think Fallout mutations.</li><li>Or as a spiritual aura that surrounds you, think Jo-Jo.</li><li>Or as a familiar that follows you around, think His Dark Materials.</li></ul><p>Your innate spell contributes to your initial position in society. However, innate spells are not 100% known at birth, until the caster casts them the first time, if ever.</p><p>Depending on the society, attempts are made to put people in places where they will be of most utility for the greater good, or profit for the local Baron or slave owner.</p><p>Innate spells can be nurtured, powered up or be changed through various means.</p><p>Innate spells can be stolen, think Heroes, but this is rare.</p><p>Spells can be gained but this requires divine intervention, the use of ancient artifacts or intense studying or journeying to the spell realm where all spells reside.</p><p>Your innate spell may influence your personality, at least that&rsquo;s what people believe.</p></section><section id=people><h1>People
<a href=#people>¶</a></h1><p>Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, a variety of other humanoids (bat people, bovine people, snake people, etc.) all co-exist in Golgea.</p><p>Sentient beings of all kinds are common in Golgea, some don&rsquo;t get along, some do, but this is usually a matter of context and circumstance rather than speciest hatred.</p><p>There is a distinct lack of mindless &ldquo;evil&rdquo; humanoids in Golgea. Truly evil humanoids who can&rsquo;t be reasoned with and will fight to the death no matter what are very rare. Exceptions to this are death cultists, the mindless undead (undead necromancers, vampires and the like excluded) and primordial evil beings from a time before Time (don&rsquo;t ask).</p></section><section id=places><h1>Places

Most believe that &ldquo;pure&rdquo; humans, regardless of skin color or creed, are above other humanoids and treat them in best case with contempt in worst cases violently.</p><p>If animal humanoids are unlucky enough to find themselves within Korgish lands, they will soon find themselves without whether they like it or not.</p><p>Considered as a threat by most of its neighbours, however the Korgish state tends to keep to itself. Controls a large landmass with abundant natural resources that are exported to neighboring lands.</p><p>Kargish dissidents who oppose the Kargish&rsquo;s states discriminatory policies exist and have been looking to overthrow the existing government but require the support of powerful allies to do so.</p></section><section id=local-factions><h3>Local Factions

<a href=#the-hearth>¶</a></h2><p>A neutral meeting ground in the center of Golgea, serves as a trading hub and acts as the home of Golgea&rsquo;s <a href=#the-merchant-guild>Merchant Guild</a>.</p><p>Anyone who is willing to buy, sell or work to help others do either, is allowed to stay at the Hearth, others are shunned.</p><p>The <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a>, and its merchant guild, is hierarchical. One&rsquo;s position in society is determined by the value they bring to the <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a> through trade or facilitating trades occurring. A rigid system of bureaucrats and accountants work diligently to keep track of everyone&rsquo;s contributions to <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a>&rsquo;s wealth.</p><p>It&rsquo;s in the interest of most to help with this process but some seek to subvert it for their own gains. The <a href=#the-merchant-guild>Merchant Guild</a> harshly punishes those who are caught by its network of auditors. But the interconnectedness of merchants and their relationships with each other discourages most from snitching. Also, the <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a>&rsquo;s large scale allows for certain less than legal transactions to fall through the cracks.</p><p>The <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a> pays all its functionaries using the funds gained through the minor transaction fees applied to each trade.</p><p>The <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a> bankrolls the Mechanist Guild and they provide the <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a> with the <a href=#the-watchmen>Watchmen</a>, mechanical golems that act as the city&rsquo;s internal security force. The <a href=#the-watchmen>Watchmen</a> are powered by an energy grid that permeates the Hearth.

<a href=#the-freemen>¶</a></h4><p>A nomadic people living in the desert beyond the <a href=#the-hearth>Hearth</a>&rsquo;s control. They travel across the sands, temporarily sheltering in ruins and dungeons when needed due to sandstorms or the group&rsquo;s needs (pregnancies, deaths), subsisting on the land and the meager fauna and flora that populate it.</p><p>The <a href=#the-freemen>Freemen</a> are attuned with the land they travel on and their elders have a deep understanding of the gods of Glogea, passed on through the generations through their oral histories.</p><p>Their connection and understanding of the gods make them effective wielders of divine relics which in addition to their martial skills make them fearsome fighters.</p><p><a href=#the-freemen>Freemen</a> groups communicate with each other as they pass one other in the world or shelter in the same place, but this happens rarely.

<a href=#the-wheeled-ones>¶</a></h2><p>To become a Wheeled One, one must forgo ever staying in the same place for long and ownership of anything that one cannot carry on their backs. Pilgrims through and through, The Wheeled Ones believe that it is only through regular travel that one can discover the truth about themselves, the world around them and the reality that underpins everything.</p><p>Seekers of truth and knowledge, the Wheeled Ones can usually be expected to tell the truth, as they understand it. Newer adepts may be innocent and ignorant, however experienced Wheeled Ones have lived a long life of wandering that usually leads them down a path to great wisdom and down-to-earth experience.</p><p>The Wheeled Ones do not worship a deity per-say but a one-ness with all things. Being a Wheeled One is less of a faith and more of a lifestyle.</p><p>Solitary travel is encouraged but choosing to travel with a group is not frowned upon. Generally, The Wheeled Ones do not exclude members from their faith.</p><p>The Wheeled Ones don&rsquo;t have a hierarchy of any kind.</p><p>You may find Wheeled Ones working as caravan guards, guides, hunters, trackers and couriers. They favor short term engagements allowing them a certain level of freedom of movement to go where they please. Most experienced Wheeled Ones no matter the environment are knowledgeable enough to subsist on local fauna and flora.</p><p>Wheeled Ones can often be found resting on the side of the road, praying at any roadside altar.</p><p>Experienced Wheeled Ones tell great stories and ask great questions.</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div></div></div></div><script defer type=text/javascript src=/js/bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
