<a href=#core-rules>¶</a></h1><p>X-Mooks is my homebrew OSR-compatible rule system.</p><p>It&rsquo;s HEAVILY based on:</p><ul><li><a href=https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html>Many Rats on a Stick by Skerples</a> (<a href=/tabletop/many_rats_on_stick_v2.pdf>PDF</a>). If there&rsquo;s something missing here, namely Wizard Schools, refer to that document to find some, if nothing speaks to you there refer to the <a href=#extra-resources>Extra Resources section</a> for more options.</li><li><a href=https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-glog-wizards.html>Goblin Punch&rsquo;s The GLOG: Wizard rules</a></li></ul><p>The X-Mooks rules are designed for old-school D&amp;D-like games. They are broadly compatible with most published Old School Revival (OSR) products (i.e. equally incompatible with all of them). The main goal is to create a system that is:</p><ol><li>Intuitive for new players.</li><li>Adaptable and hackable.</li><li>Compact.</li></ol><p>The rules assume you know what an RPG is, what dice are, and the basics of OSR games, and how to adjudicate rules on the fly. Rather than a complete system, this hack is designed to allow experience GMs to run games for experienced players.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a player, <a href=#introduction-for-new-players>start with the Introduction for New Players section</a>. If you want more detail on how a particular system works, refer to the <a href=#table-of-contents>table of contents</a> or Control+F to search for info.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a GM, <a href=#gm-guidance>start with the GM guidance section</a>.</p></section><section id=gm-guidance><h2>GM Guidance
<a href=#gm-guidance>¶</a></h2><p>Only roll or call for a roll if both success and failure are interesting. If failure is inevitable because of the fiction, don&rsquo;t roll. A PC can&rsquo;t test Strength to flap their arms and fly to the moon. If failure is boring, don&rsquo;t roll. If the PCs fail to pick a simple mundane lock, and they have all the time in the world, they&rsquo;ll just keep rolling until they succeed. Just let them open it or apply a time penalty. If the PCs not spotting something means they&rsquo;ll never see it, just tell them what they see. No rolls required.</p><p>Failed rolls have consequences. The most obvious one is time. Wasted time means more chances for bad things to happen to the PCs.</p><p>Roll sparingly. Because stats are randomly generated and assigned, it&rsquo;s possible two PCs in the same party will have vastly different chances of performing the same task. Minimize this by using Attack and Save (which are the same for most PCs at the same level), automatic failures, and automatic successes.</p><p>From a player&rsquo;s point of view, a roll is a risk. Testing Strength to leap across a chasm is risky. Putting a ladder across a chasm and climbing across is less risky and does not require a roll. Fighting is a risk. Avoiding the fight entirely may not require a roll.</p></section><section id=the-core-mechanic><h2>The Core Mechanic
<a href=#the-core-mechanic>¶</a></h2><p>Almost everything is based on rolling a <button onclick='roll("1d20",this)'>1d20</button>. If you roll equal to or under a target number, you succeed. Roll over, and you fail.</p><p>Throughout the text, whenever you see &ldquo;Roll under&mldr;&rdquo;, it means &ldquo;Roll equal to or under&mldr;&rdquo;.</p></section><section id=skills><h2>Skills
<a href=#skills>¶</a></h2><p>Skills are just a word that describes something a PC knows how to do. There are no specific rules for using them. You may call for rolls under Intelligence or another stat, but in general, just let the PC with the skill do the thing the skill describes.</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-sm"><thead><tr><th>Stat</th><th>Bonus</th><th>Stat</th><th>Bonus</th><th>Stat</th><th>Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>-3</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>17</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-3</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>18</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>-2</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>19</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>-2</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>-2</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>21</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>-1</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>22</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>-1</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>23</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>-1</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section id=stats><h2>Stats
<a href=#stats>¶</a></h2><p>Characters have 6 stats. Each stat has a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;, which is a sort of shorthand condensation of a stat. Don&rsquo;t add the bonus to rolls.</p><p><strong>Strength</strong>: Roll under Strength to open doors, tear apart chains, or climb a cliff. The number of items a character can carry is determined by their Strength score. The damage a character inflicts in melee combat is modified by their Strength bonus.</p><p><strong>Dexterity</strong>: Roll under Dexterity to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate tasks under pressure. A character&rsquo;s Defense, Movement, and Stealth are modified by their dexterity bonus.</p><p><strong>Constitution</strong>: Roll under Constitution to resist cold, disease, fatigue, drowning, and poison. A character&rsquo;s Hit Points are based on their Constitution.</p><p><strong>Intelligence</strong>: Roll under Intelligence to solve difficult puzzles, read obscure texts, or identify items and treasure.</p><p><strong>Wisdom</strong>: Roll under Wisdom to see through lies, spot hidden dangers, and avoid mind-altering spells. Characters will also use Wisdom to determine the order of combat.</p><p><strong>Charisma</strong>: Roll under Charisma to flatter, beguile, or barter. A character&rsquo;s Save is modified by their Charisma bonus.</p></section><section id=associated-numbers><h2>Associated Numbers
<a href=#associated-numbers>¶</a></h2><p><strong>Attack</strong>: Starts at 11. Increases with level. Roll under Attack, opposed by the enemy&rsquo;s Defense, to hit.</p><p><strong>Defense</strong>: <code>10 + Dex. Bonus OR bonus from armour</code>. Leather is +2, Chain is +4, Plate is +6, a shield is +1.</p><p><strong>Movement</strong>: <code>12 + Dex. Bonus - Armour penalty</code>. How fast a character can move. Penalized by armour (-0 for Leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).</p><p><strong>Stealth</strong>: <code>5 + Dex. Bonus - Armour penalty</code>. Applied as a penalty to opponents Wisdom to see if a character is noticed. Penalized by armour (-0 for Leather, -2 for Chain, -4 for Plate).</p><p><strong>Save</strong>: <code>5 + Cha. Bonus</code>. Increases with level. If an effect, attack, or challenge doesn&rsquo;t fall under any of the other stats or values, roll Save. This represents a character&rsquo;s luck and determination to resist the cruel hand of fate.</p></section><section id=opposed-rolls><h2>Opposed Rolls
<a href=#opposed-rolls>¶</a></h2><p>A character or NPC must roll equal to or under their stat, modified by <code>10-[the relevant stat of their opponent]</code>.</p><p>E.g. Shoving. The PC has 11 Strength, the orc has 14 Strength. The PC needs to roll a 7 or less to succeed (<code>11 + [10-14]</code>).</p><p>Chess. The PC has a Intelligence of 6, the goblin has an Intelligence of 4. The PC needs to roll a 12 or less to succeed.</p><p>Racing. The PC has a Movement of 12, the gladiator has a Movement of 14. The PC must roll under 8 to thoroughly beat the gladiator in a race.</p></section><section id=adjudicating-rolls><h2>Adjudicating Rolls
<a href=#adjudicating-rolls>¶</a></h2><p>A -4 penalty is approximately the same as &ldquo;reroll and take the worse of the two results.&rdquo; A +4 bonus is approximately the same as &ldquo;reroll and take the better result.&rdquo;</p><p>Apply bonuses or penalties to rolls as needed. Go as far as you need to go, bearing in mind that if you&rsquo;re adding enough bonuses or penalties rolling may be pointless.</p></section><section id=combat><h1>Combat
<a href=#combat>¶</a></h1><p>Switch to combat rounds when it looks like someone might get hurt.</p><p>If someone (or a group) attacks by surprise, they get to act before any Initiatives are rolled for the round. Once all ambushers have acted, everyone rolls for Initiative.</p></section><section id=initiative><h2>Initiative
<a href=#initiative>¶</a></h2><p>Each round of combat, a PC must roll under their Wisdom. If they succeed, they act before their enemies. If they fail, they act afterwards. They act in order of their rolls, lowest to highest. Some particularly quick enemies might impose a penalty on PCs&rsquo; Wisdom, or act twice in each round.</p></section><section id=on-their-turn><h2>On Their Turn
<a href=#on-their-turn>¶</a></h2><p>A PC or enemy can do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Make an Attack roll against a target.</li><li>Run about 50&rsquo;+Movement (or 60&rsquo;).</li><li>Make a charge attack against a target (Move 20&rsquo;+Movement and then make an Attack roll).</li><li>Cast a spell or activate a magic item.</li><li>Retrieve an item from a non-quickdraw slot.</li><li>Reload a crossbow, etc.</li><li>Try to trip, shove, or push a target.</li><li>Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a dying ally.</li></ul><p>In addition, a PC or enemy can move 20&rsquo;+Movement (or 30&rsquo;).</p><p>Talking, shouting, or dropping an item can be done freely, and possibly even in other peoples&rsquo; turns. Basically, you can do one big thing a turn, plus move a bit.</p></section><section id=attack-rolls><h2>Attack Rolls
<a href=#attack-rolls>¶</a></h2><p>Roll under Attack, opposed by the enemy&rsquo;s Defense, to hit.</p><p>E.g. A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a goblin with no armour. The Thief has to roll under 11.</p><p>A 1st-level Thief with Attack 11 tries to hit a very nimble tiger (armour as chain). The Thief has to roll under 7 (<code>11+ [10-14]</code>).</p><p>Other effects (drunkenness, fog, being on fire, etc.) may impose penalties to Attack.</p><p>Ranged weapons get -1 to Attack for every 10&rsquo; beyond their listed range.</p><p>Most spells do not require an Attack roll. If a spell does require one, it will be noted in the spell&rsquo;s description. Touching an unwilling target always requires an Attack roll.</p></section><section id=critical-successes-and-failures><h2>Critical Successes and Failures
<a href=#critical-successes-and-failures>¶</a></h2><p>On an unmodified Attack roll of 1, the attack deals double damage (roll twice the number of dice and add any bonuses twice).</p><p>On an unmodified Attack roll of 20, the attack automatically misses. Further penalties may apply if the situation is risky. A critical failure in a one-on-one fight in a clear meadow might just be a miss. A critical failure in a tight corridor, with allies and enemies jostling together, might result in an ally being hit, a weapon being dropped, or the attacker falling prone.</p></section><section id=damage><h2>Damage
<a href=#damage>¶</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Light weapons</strong> (daggers) deal <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> + Strength bonus damage.</li><li><strong>Medium weapons</strong> (swords) deal <button onclick='roll("1d8",this)'>1d8</button> + Strength bonus damage if wielded in one hand or <button onclick='roll("1d10",this)'>1d10</button> + Strength bonus damage if wielded in both hands.</li><li><strong>Heavy weapons</strong> (hammers) deal <button onclick='roll("1d12",this)'>1d12</button> + Strength bonus damage but must be wielded in both hands.</li><li><strong>Thrown light weapons</strong> deal <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> damage.</li><li><strong>Bows</strong> and <strong>Slings</strong> deal <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> damage.</li><li><strong>Crossbows</strong> deal <button onclick='roll("1d12",this)'>1d12</button> damage.</li></ul></section><section id=hit-points><h2>Hit Points
<a href=#hit-points>¶</a></h2><p>The danger a character can resist before taking injury is quantified by Hit Points (HP). They are better thought of as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Get Hit&rdquo; Points. There are no mechanical effects for being reduced to 0 HP. Any damage in excess of this (i.e. negative HP) is known as Lethal Damage, which always incurs a roll on the Death and Dismemberment Table.</p><p>PCs have a maximum HP of 20. Enemies have variable HP base on their Hit Dice (HD). A hit dice is a <button onclick='roll("1d8",this)'>1d8</button>. Roll the number of HD listed and add the numbers together. An enemy with surprisingly low HP might be sickly or wounded. An enemy with high HP might be a champion (or two enemies).</p></section><section id=healing><h2>Healing
<a href=#healing>¶</a></h2><ol><li>Lunch heals a character for <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> + Level HP. Lunch takes 1 hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1 ration.</li><li>A Good Night&rsquo;s Rest. Restores all HP. Requires 8 hours of rest, a safe place, a fire or heat source, and consumes 1 ration.</li><li>Magical Healing. Some spells or potions restore HP. Others can heal Injuries.</li></ol><p>If a character has negative HP (i.e. has taken Lethal Damage), the next Lunch or Good Night&rsquo;s Rest heals them to 0 and not over 0.</p></section><section id=weapon-proficiency><h2>Weapon Proficiency
<a href=#weapon-proficiency>¶</a></h2><p>All classes are proficient with daggers. A PC is also proficient with any weapons they gain from a class or background. A PC has -4 to Attack with a weapon until they gain proficiency by landing 8 successful hits in combat.</p></section><section id=reaction--morale-rolls><h2>Reaction & Morale Rolls
<a href=#reaction--morale-rolls>¶</a></h2><p>When encountering monsters, roll <button onclick='roll("2d6",this)'>2d6</button> + the Charisma bonus of the most visible party member.</p><script type=text/javascript>gen_data.ReactionRole={"1-2":"Immediate Attack","3-7":"Unfavourable","8-11":"Favourable",12:"Very Favourable"};function pickRandomlyFromTableReactionRole(){document.getElementById("table_result_ReactionRole").innerHTML=generate_text("ReactionRole")}</script><button onclick=pickRandomlyFromTableReactionRole()>Generate 1 random ReactionRole!</button><br><span id=table_result_ReactionRole></span><br><p>Monsters (or hirelings) may try to run away or surrender if combat turns against them. Monsters have a Morale value listed from 2 (craven) to 12 (unbreakable). Check Morale when:</p><ol><li>The side (PCs or monsters) takes their first death.</li><li>When half the side has been incapacitated or killed.</li><li>If some particularly frightening or spectacular effect occurs. Roll <button onclick='roll("2d6",this)'>2d6</button>. If the result is over the creatures&rsquo; Morale score, the creature attempts to retreat, surrenders, or panics. Morale can be adjusted (unless 2 or 12) by situational bonuses.</li></ol></section><section id=injuries-death--dismemberment><h1>Injuries, Death & Dismemberment
<a href=#injuries-death--dismemberment>¶</a></h1></section><section id=death-and-dismemberment-roll><h2>Death and Dismemberment Roll
<a href=#death-and-dismemberment-roll>¶</a></h2><p><button onclick='roll("1d12",this)'>1d12</button> + Lethal Damage + Number of Current Injuries</p><p>The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current Injuries rolls a 10 on a <button onclick='roll("1d12",this)'>1d12</button>, to the leg, <code>X = 10+8+0 = 18</code>. They gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for 18 days.</p><p>If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll <code>1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled)</code> for <code>1d12 + 11</code>.</p></section><section id=hit-location-table><h2>Hit Location Table
<a href=#hit-location-table>¶</a></h2><p>If required, roll <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> for hit location.</p><script type=text/javascript>gen_data.HitLocation={"1+":"Disabled X Days","11+":"1 Fatal Wound + Mangled","16+":"X-15 Fatal Wounds"};function pickRandomlyFromTableHitLocation(){document.getElementById("table_result_HitLocation").innerHTML=generate_text("HitLocation")}</script><button onclick=pickRandomlyFromTableHitLocation()>Generate 1 random HitLocation!</button><br><span id=table_result_HitLocation></span><br></section><section id=status-effect-table><h2>Status Effect Table

<a href=#fatal-wounds>¶</a></h2><p>A PC has 3 rounds to clear all their Fatal Wounds or they die. They can attempt to remove a Fatal Wound on their turn by rolling 1 on a <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button>. PCs with Fatal Wounds are unconscious. This does not mean they are quiet or asleep (they can be screaming and holding a stump), but it means they cannot take conscious or deliberate actions. Remove oldest Fatal Wounds first.</p><p>Up to two adjacent allies can try to remove Fatal Wounds from a dying character by spending their turn doctoring the wounded PC and then rolling under ½ Intelligence (unless they have a useful skill).</p></section><section id=injuries><h2>Injuries
<a href=#injuries>¶</a></h2><p>Some injuries on this list aren&rsquo;t on the Death and Dismemberment table. They can be accumulated by other means, GM choice, or deliberate actions.</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong>: Cannot benefit from magical healing or be the target of beneficial magic.</p><p><strong>Blind</strong>: Cannot see. -8 to Attack and Defense.

<a href=#introduction-for-new-players>¶</a></h1><p><strong>There are elements of chance.</strong></p><p>Ever played cops and robbers or any other made-up games? Did you ever meet the one kid who said &ldquo;Nuh uh, you didn&rsquo;t hit me, I have a bulletproof vest!&rdquo; In this game of make-believe, there are a few rules to help decide who hits who, and how hard, and other things like that.</p><p>Your characters are also going to have some random numbers assigned to them. Sometimes the numbers will be good, and sometimes they&rsquo;ll be bad, and there&rsquo;s not much you can do about it. In this game the numbers aren&rsquo;t that important. Sometimes, a character will terrible stats and survive for ages, while a character with brilliant stats dies in the first hour of game.</p><p><strong>There are elements of skill.</strong></p><p>In Settlers of Catan, the rules are fixed and solid and balanced. You can&rsquo;t go &ldquo;Hey Steve, I&rsquo;ll take my Knights and you take your Knights and we&rsquo;ll go pillage that Sheep tile.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not in the rules. And that&rsquo;s fine. But in a game like this, you can come up with any plans you want to. In that way the game is like a real world, and the people in it are like real people. Nobody minds too much if you go around smashing pottery and looting houses in a video game, but in this game, that sort of thing has real consequences. Similarly, you can&rsquo;t lure Bowser out of his castle with a delicious meal in the video game because cooking wasn&rsquo;t coded into the game.</p><p>Coming up with a good plan and executing that plan is important. Be smart. Pay attention. Think of solutions that the rules don&rsquo;t cover.</p><p><strong>In Character vs Out of Character</strong></p><p>You don&rsquo;t have to do silly voices or wear costumes. You&rsquo;ll figure out how comfortable you are acting as your character as we go along. The main thing, right now, is to remember that your character knows things you don&rsquo;t know, and that you know things your character doesn&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Your character knows things about the world that you, as a player, don&rsquo;t know. They know how to ride a horse or make poison or identify magic runes. If there&rsquo;s a situation where that applies, I&rsquo;ll just tell you what your character knows. If I&rsquo;m not sure, I might make you roll for it.</p><p>Similarly, there are things you know that your characters don&rsquo;t know. The main one is reason. We live in a logical age; the characters you&rsquo;re playing don&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t have the benefit of a post-Enlightenment education. They might not even be literate. You aren&rsquo;t afraid of the weather because you understand what weather is. Your characters don&rsquo;t. They might not understand things that we take for granted, and they might act on motives that we&rsquo;d find archaic or ridiculous.</p><p>You, the player, might know things about other characters or the world that your character doesn&rsquo;t. You might know a secret about another character&rsquo;s past, or the best way to kill a vampire. But remember, your character can only act on knowledge they have in the game.We&rsquo;ll discuss this more as it comes up.</p><p><strong>Your characters are going to die.</strong></p><p>Did you ever play Super Mario Bros? Mario died a lot in that game. Sometimes he died because you made a mistake. Sometimes it was chance, or luck, or you were distracted, or you didn&rsquo;t understand how an enemy worked. This game is like that, except in the video game, Mario comes back again and again. In this game, each time you get a new character.</p><p>Having a character die doesn&rsquo;t mean you made a mistake or failed. It&rsquo;s part of the learning process. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just random chance.</p><p>You get to make a new character, and I&rsquo;ll find a way to introduce them to the group. You start at Level 1 again but it&rsquo;s not a big deal. A Level 1 character is just as useful as a Level 4 character almost every way. You&rsquo;ll never be completely outclassed.</p><p><strong>Levelling Up</strong></p><p>You level up and improve your character by looting treasure. Imagine a dragon and its hoard. Kill the dragon and you get 0 XP. Steal the treasure, by force or stealth, and it counts. You have to get it out of the dungeon and take it somewhere safe, but once it&rsquo;s safe - buried, spent, invested, or donated - it counts.</p><p><strong>The Social Contract</strong></p><p>If you like this game and you&rsquo;re having fun, show up on time, or tell me in advance if you can&rsquo;t make it. If you don&rsquo;t like this game, let me know and we&rsquo;ll make changes. If anything about this game makes you uncomfortable, bring it up immediately. If you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that, or it only occurs to you later, you can always email me.</p><p>Please don&rsquo;t bring out your phones during game unless there&rsquo;s something urgent. Ideally this is the most interesting thing going on. In the same vein, understand that there are 5 other people in the room, so don&rsquo;t deliberately waste time.</p><p><strong>The Rules</strong></p><p>Are always available for you to read. They aren&rsquo;t secret. If you find inconsistencies or errors, let me know, but the rules aren&rsquo;t the law. As the GM, what I say goes, and if need be, what I say, went. If you think you&rsquo;ve found a loophole, but the results of that loophole don&rsquo;t make any sense, it will stop working immediately.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p><p>If you have questions, let me know. Some example questions include:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Can I hit him with an arrow at this distance?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;What does X taste like?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Does my character know anything about X?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;How much damage does a longsword do if I throw it at someone?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Before we start, do you have any questions right now?</p></section><section id=character-generation><h1>Character Generation

All PCs start at level 1 with Template A of the Wizard class with a Wizard School of their choice to represent their innate magical potential manifested.

A wizard&rsquo;s spells range in intelligence from pond scum to ferrets. A spellbook is a menagerie-prison. A well-trained brain is a mind-gun loaded with spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips, infest a wizard&rsquo;s soul and bind to it. It takes 1 hour to move any number of spells between a spell slot in your brain and a spellbook, scroll, or wand.</p><p>To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Wizard, you get +1 MD per Wizard template. Most spells depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles generate Mishaps (bad); triples generate Dooms (worse). Casting a spell from a scroll provides +1 MD as the scroll burns.</p><p>Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the day. Your spells return at sunrise to last location they were imprisoned, when the octarine light of the sun touches the world and infuses Creation with an extra boost of raw magic. Your MD return if you get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. If you didn&rsquo;t sleep well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool anyway.</p><p>When you gain Template A, roll <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> and gain the spell listed. Template B, roll a <button onclick='roll("1d6",this)'>1d6</button> and a <button onclick='roll("1d8",this)'>1d8</button>. Template C, roll <button onclick='roll("1d10",this)'>1d10</button>. Template D, choose 4 spells from the list. If a duplicate spell is rolled, you may choose to keep it or reroll.</p><p>You can try to bodge together a spell-like effect appropriate to your school by pouring any number of MD into a target and hoping for the best. Effects are adjudicated by the GM, but are usually haphazard and dangerous. Mishaps and Dooms apply.</p><p>You can detect strong ambient magic if you are not distracted. To learn details about spells or magic items, roll under Intelligence.</p></section><section id=b-book-casting><h4>B: Book Casting
<a href=#b-book-casting>¶</a></h4><p>+1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spell (1-6), +1 Spell (1-8)</p><p>You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn. You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.</p></section><section id=c-friendly-spell><h4>C: Friendly Spell
