The campaign’s premise and flavor
You play as potential recruits of FIST (Freelance Infantry Strike Team), a scrappy private military company employing many exceptional misfits just like you. You&rsquo;ve just begun to gain control over your powers (what kind of powers would a Metal Gear Solid boss have?), use them effectively or die trying.
You&rsquo;re being sent on your first mission. If you survive you&rsquo;ll be given a year-long contract, some minimal health care benefits and a basic life insurance policy...." property="og:description"><meta content="https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/fist/" property="og:url"><meta content="#43B581" data-react-helmet=true name=theme-color><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href="/apple-touch-icon.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href="/favicon-32x32.png?v=1"><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href="/favicon-16x16.png?v=1"><link rel=manifest href="/site.webmanifest?v=1"><link rel=mask-icon href="/safari-pinned-tab.svg?v=1" color=#5bbad5><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico?v=1"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#da532c"><meta name=theme-color content="#ff0000"><meta name=description content="Author: strategineer, category: tabletop, description: "><link href="/css/site.min.afd085864f5670f26de92541c02e3d580b1bf4b02d85ab1db2baa2c8f3ef7cb5.css" rel=stylesheet><title>FIST - Campaign Journal</title></head><body id=documentTop><div class=container-fluid><div class="row no-margin justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-12 main no-margin"><div class=row><nav class="col footer-index"><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="container author-blurb"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class=col-auto><img loading=lazy alt="Strat's Avatar" class="rounded avatar-static float-left" src=/favicon.ico></div><div class="col-auto align-self-center"><div class=row><div class="col-auto text-center"><a href=/#about-me>Name's Strat; I'm a rooster illusion.</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></nav></div><div class="row justify-content-center text-center page-title"><div class="col-md-7 h1">FIST - Campaign Journal</div></div><div class=readable></section><section id=one-pager><h1>One Pager
<a href=#one-pager>¶</a></h1><p><strong>The campaign’s premise and flavor</strong></p><p>You play as potential recruits of FIST (Freelance Infantry Strike Team), a scrappy private military company employing many exceptional misfits just like you. You&rsquo;ve just begun to gain control over your powers (what kind of powers would a Metal Gear Solid boss have?), use them effectively or die trying.</p><p>You&rsquo;re being sent on your first mission. If you survive you&rsquo;ll be given a year-long contract, some minimal health care benefits and a basic life insurance policy.</p><p>FIST have been notified that the Elder God worshipping pirates at BOOTY are planning to take control of Effrey Jepstein&rsquo;s private island the next time he&rsquo;s planning to throw one of his infamous &ldquo;parties&rdquo;, sacrificing the party-goers to their God. Our client has asked to use this as a cover to infiltrate the island and &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; certain high tech gadgets that Jepstein&rsquo;s has put on display throughout the island to show off to his guests.</p><p>Will you survive your first mission with FIST and, more importantly, will you look cool doing it?</p><p><strong>What separates this one-shot from others?</strong></p><ul><li>A simple tabletop roleplaying system perfect for introducing players into it without much friction.</li><li>A modern-ish day setting. What would the world look like if the Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t collapse and the Cold War never ended.</li><li>A focus on collaborative storytelling and player choice.</li></ul><p><strong>What are the main things about this one-shot that the characters would know going in?</strong></p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re encouraged to collaborate and get along with your fellow potential FIST recruits because there are few PMCs like FIST willing to hire and train people like you without any prior experience or mastery of your powers.</li></ul><p><strong>What potentially troubling themes might this one-shot include?</strong></p><p>Cartoon violence. Politics. Setting featuring late stage capitalist dystopias and hive mind post-communist ones. References to Jeffrey Epstein but nothing explicit, just super rich guys sucking.</p><p>If anything potentially troubling comes up through play and anyone isn&rsquo;t into it, we&rsquo;ll either fast forward through it or go back in time and make other choices to avoid it.</p></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center col-12"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/labyrinth-of-the-blue-gorgon/>▶️Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon - Campaign Journal</a></div></div></div></div></nav></div></div><div class=end-page></div></div></div></div><script defer type=text/javascript src=/js/bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
