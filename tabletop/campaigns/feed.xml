&lt;p>&lt;strong>The campaign’s premise and flavor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You play as potential recruits of FIST (Freelance Infantry Strike Team), a scrappy private military company employing many exceptional misfits just like you. You&amp;rsquo;ve just begun to gain control over your powers (what kind of powers would a Metal Gear Solid boss have?), use them effectively or die trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re being sent on your first mission. If you survive you&amp;rsquo;ll be given a year-long contract, some minimal health care benefits and a basic life insurance policy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon - Campaign Notes</title><link>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/labyrinth-of-the-blue-gorgon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/labyrinth-of-the-blue-gorgon/</guid><description>&lt;p>Session Summaries, One-Pager and WIP Post-Mortem thoughts on my Labyrinth of the Blue Gorgon campaign.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tomorrow Legion Never Dies - Campaign Notes</title><link>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/tomorrow-never-dies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/tabletop/campaigns/tomorrow-never-dies/</guid><description>&lt;/section>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The campaign’s premise and flavor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In December 2098, the Great Cataclysm ended the Golden Age of Mankind and brought with it torrents of magical energies tearing open rifts in space and time all over Earth. Out of those rifts came creatures long extinct, aliens and previously thought to be supernatural beings of all kinds. The remnants of humanity cowered in the shadows as the world as they knew it shattered around them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
