Intro
    
        ¶
    



Begin first mission in-media-res &mdash; a first mission gone wrong.
Throw a few different ideas / factions into the mix &mdash; allowing players to choose which part of the bigger picture to unravel first (is everything connected?)
See arcs below&mldr; We can set them up here.
We&rsquo;ve got one living doppleganger of the PCs with the rest dead. We&rsquo;ve got killer robots going on a rampage. We&rsquo;ve got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.
The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape

Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?

<a href=#one-pager-draft>¶</a></h1><p><strong>The campaign’s premise and flavor</strong></p><p>HOOK</p><p>PREMISE</p><p>QUESTION?</p><p><strong>What separates this campaign from others?</strong></p><ul><li>Everything and the kitchen sink design turned up to 11, mowing down demons with mech suits, &mldr;, the setting and system allows for you to create any character you want to and have it &ldquo;work&rdquo; with every other character that players want to play and the system supports it.</li><li>A open-ended setting that can support the wacky kind of roleplaying that I enjoy.</li><li>A more mechanically dense and crunchier system with strong Foundry VTT support to allow for a hassle-free experience for both players and GM. I expect balancing combat encounters to be a challenge, more or less depending on what kinds of characters you want to play, but one that I&rsquo;m up to.</li><li>High lethality?</li></ul><p><strong>What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?</strong></p><ul><li>The <a href=https://peginc.com/product/rifts-welcome-to-the-post-apocalypse-pdf/>basic premise of the Savage Rifts setting</a> &mdash; basically a post-post-apocalypse kicked off by the cataclysmic return of magic on Earth and the opening of inter-dimensional portals all over it &mdash; creating a pressure cooker environment with cyborgs, demons, aliens from outer and inner space, fascists, anything you can think of rubbing up against one another.</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul><p><strong>What characters work best in the campaign?</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;ll be using the Savage Worlds ruleset for this campaign, with any character classes/edges/skills/etc. from the Savage Rifts expansion/sourcebooks books being fair-game.</p><p>I want to support absolutely any kind of wacky character in this campaign. This ranges from a human living in the post-post-apocalypse trying their best to survive, a previously hive mind-ed alien who finds themselves separated from the hive after falling into a portal to Earth, a spirit bonded to a suit of armor, &mldr;</p><p><strong>What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m not expecting to get into anything too challenging thematically in this campaign. Although, I&rsquo;m expecting to separate the campaign into several shorter and thematically-cohesive arcs. If this changes, we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p><p>This setting assumes that not everyone can be reasoned with. True inherent evil does exist, good does too and PCs will fall somewhere in the middle (probably).</p><p><strong>What group patrons might the players select as a group? Who might serve as their primary quest giver?</strong></p><ul><li>The player characters will be new recruits of the Tomorrow Legion, doing field work in and around Castle Refuge.
