&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Begin first mission in-media-res &amp;mdash; a first mission gone wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Throw a few different ideas / factions into the mix &amp;mdash; allowing players to choose which part of the bigger picture to unravel first (is everything connected?)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="#arc---ideas">See arcs below&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; We can set them up here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve got one living doppleganger of the PCs with the rest dead. We&amp;rsquo;ve got killer robots going on a rampage. We&amp;rsquo;ve got demons chasing after non-demons (telepathic? they can express their non-evil-ness). All sides are fighting all other sides and the PCs are stuck in the middle of it all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The PCs are hunkered down in a bunker of some kind fending off attackers on all sides. Objective: Survive / Escape
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Repair a vehicle and roll out? Fend off the attack? Hide and hope for the best? Ally with one side against the others?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;ve run a few games centered around Castle Refuge now - here&amp;rsquo;s what I tend to focus on: (TL,DR - Think Rebel Alliance (Star Wars) at Yavin IV, led and run by the MCU Avengers (with all their big personalities), in a world that is part Port Protection and part The Walking Dead, with Nazis to your North and South, and Sauron to your East.)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
