I&rsquo;ve been reading up and thinking about Old School Renaissance RPG systems and settings for a few weeks and you can see the influence of that here.</p><p>The session went well but the use of mutant cockroaches as one of the factions acted as a pretty strong railroad to encourage players to side with the human workers due to the setting. That wasn&rsquo;t the intention. I wanted to players to really have a choice between siding with the humans factory workers, the cockroaches (and maybe even the robots).</p><p>If I were to run this again, I would swap out the cockroaches and instead have two human Infrared human factions (the Laborers and the Office Workers) fighting with each other, neither of which are communists but both of which believe they have better ideas about how to increase the factory&rsquo;s efficiency. Or something like that.</p><p>Another problem was that I didn&rsquo;t prep any way to reveal the map properly as the players ran through it. I just took screenshots of sections of the map as they were revealed. Mas suggested I use an image manipulation program with two layers that I could gradually reveal. That would have been way better.</p><p>Or I could use a VTT (probably something simple like <a href=https://www.owlbear.rodeo/)>https://www.owlbear.rodeo/)</a>, but that requires a bit more setup. I would use tonly do that if it&rsquo;s really important for PCs to be physically positioned in specific places with stat-based or effect-based restrictions on movement.</p><p>Another thing was that I did write down some events that happened during the course of play to bring up during the mission debriefing at the end of the session. The mission debriefing was a fun part of the session but it might been better to also write down a note any time the Computer die came up. Those moments in particular will be remembered by the players and me and tended to be pretty comical. So remembering to bring them up in during the debriefing would have been fun.</p><p>Another thing. The special R&amp;D homonym-based equipment I came up with was fun but I should have looked around for some more inspiration, maybe some tables of funny equipment I could have used online.</p></section><section id=character-creation><h1>Character creation
<a href=#character-creation>¶</a></h1><p>While the players are doing the following steps, the GM should generate the jobs and secret roles for the players using <a href=/bin/paranoia/>this tool</a> and DM them the results (NB: the first card is public information, the other two are secret.)</p><ul><li>Right click and download the <a href=/decks/paranoia.html>character sheet</a>.</li><li>Click the &ldquo;Randomize&rdquo; button on the bottom right of the screen.</li><li>Look at the stats and skills then give your character an appropriate punny name.</li><li>Click on File and Save As&mldr; and save another file for this sheet.</li><li>Upload the sheet to discord and give it to another player, they&rsquo;ll play be playing the character you generated.</li></ul></section><section id=tutorial><h1>Tutorial
<a href=#tutorial>¶</a></h1><p>PCs begin play:</p><p><strong>You find yourself in a dark instructional video viewing room. You&rsquo;re strapped in to your seats and your eyelids are being pulled back by some sort of device with their eyelids watching a series of instructional videos telling them some of what they need to know to succeed at being troubleshooter.</strong></p><blockquote><p><p>Welcome troubleshooters to your first day troubleshootings. You find yourselves in the Alpha Complex. It&rsquo;s something like Portal&rsquo;s Aperture Science Facility but instead of an underground facility for just doing science, it&rsquo;s supposed to be a completely enclosed ecosystem/world.</p><p>The facility is managed by an all-seeing Computer (The Computer), think Glados but more british.</p><p>You are playing as new troubleshooters, it&rsquo;s your first day on the job. A troubleshooter&rsquo;s role is to deal with any problems that come up in the Alpha Complex. As players, you know that the Alpha Complex is falling apart and in a constant state of disrepair. The Computer is no longer capable of maintaining the facility and it doesn&rsquo;t understand why. The Computer has ratched up the surveillance state and blames everyone but itself for the Alpha Complex&rsquo;s problems.</p><p>Remember the following:</p><ol><li>The Computer is infallible. The Computer is recording everything you see through your implants however it only focuses on what you&rsquo;re doing specifically when it hears gunfire, explosions, the word &ldquo;Treason&rdquo; or whenever it feels like it.</li><li>Being a Mutant or a Traitor is punishable by death. Secret Societies are treasonous.</li><li>You can only be tried for a crime once (clones aren&rsquo;t punished by other clones&rsquo;s crimes).</li></ol></p></blockquote><p>Colonel Kernel (old haggard military man, white hair, beret, yellow clearance) enters the room, salutes the group of newly minted troubleshooters, gives the players their iLiveToServe device, gives minimal hints and leaves room for questions.</p><p>Players are given the illusion of choice and presented with three missions through their service device (they can only pick one), players go to R&amp;D department and meet Jefferson, the R&amp;D technician, who assigns everyone on major tool but they aren&rsquo;t allowed to test out their equipmennt before they&rsquo;re in the field. Jefferson will ask them to report back to R&amp;D HQ with their in-field testing results.</p></section><section id=mission><h1>Mission

<a href=#solutions>¶</a></h3><ul><li>Kill the humans and let the cockroaches take over the factory (they can extrete soy sauce from their bodies OR they can turn the humans into vinegar).</li><li>Re-Subjugate the cockroaches, killing any who refuse to work, under the human management.</li></ul></section><section id=npcs><h3>NPCs
<a href=#npcs>¶</a></h3><ul><li>The Secretary - Ingrid: very old, extremely tired.

He was assigned a later shift today and is getting ready to start his day.

If the troubleshooters loot the lockers, that&rsquo;s theft.</li><li>Break Room: Zezeticktick is here. Hot brown liquid dispensing room. Zeze is a species traitor is wearing business casual attire and trying to get some hot brown liquid inside him however the machine is empty.</li><li>Janitor&rsquo;s Recharging Zone: Sounds can be heard coming from within this room.
