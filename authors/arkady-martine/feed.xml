They&amp;rsquo;re incomplete but I&amp;rsquo;m posting them here mostly un-edited (just some typo fixes) for posterity. They&amp;rsquo;re either too incomplete, too snarky, too snooty or too mean-spirited to post on Goodreads.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Memory Called Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-29/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Memory Called Empire has big &amp;ldquo;Hugo award winner&amp;rdquo; energy: an interesting premise, consistent and intriguing world building, a promising start and a propulsive ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I loved my time with it and very excited to dig into the next book in the series although I suspect that it won&amp;rsquo;t be as good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
