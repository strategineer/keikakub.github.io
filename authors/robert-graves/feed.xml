related to the Greek myths rather than a pure retelling of the myths themselves.
It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to entertain, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to inform. Although, if learning
everything there is to know about Greek myths sounds entertaining to you then
this is the book for you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
