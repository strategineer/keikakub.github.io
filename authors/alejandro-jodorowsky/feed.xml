The art styles of each short comic are varied as you can imagine, and some are surprisingly good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Royal Blood</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781782760979/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781782760979/</guid><description>&lt;p>Gorgeous art by Dongzi Liu can&amp;rsquo;t save the horrendous writing by Jodorowsky. The extremely taboo and fucked up premise for this is one thing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll read a story about anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just so bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot begin to imagine what sort of circumstances would have led to the production of this comic. That&amp;rsquo;s the story I want to read about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Angel Claws</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650123/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650123/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jodorowsky and Moebius being horny on main and getting into some Freudian hijinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Moebius black and white art appreciated by some, and I can see why after reading Angel Claws.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eyes Of The Cat</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650420/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650420/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>Whenever he [Moebius] finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spiritual pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.&lt;/p>
