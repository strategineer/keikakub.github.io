&lt;p>Jodorowsky and Moebius being horny on main and getting into some Freudian hijinks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Moebius black and white art appreciated by some, and I can see why after reading Angel Claws.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eyes Of The Cat</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650420/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781594650420/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>In those years, between about 1977-1978, Moebius lived in a house about thirty miles outside of Paris. Whenever he finished a page, he would call me on the telephone. Driven by an irresistible curiosity, I would immediately get in my car to go see him. Every time I saw a new page, I swear on the life of my cat Kazan that I experienced a spirituall pleasure exceeding that of an orgasm. There before my eyes, I had the undeniable proof that comic book art was great art, just as respectable as the paintings hanging on the walls of museums.&lt;/p>
