Russ is a poet and it shows. In The Female Man, she hits the reader with evocative, vulgar and shocking words and images that hold up four decades later (mostly).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, the text would probably collapse in on itself against a basic trans reading of it&amp;hellip; In comparison, Russ&amp;rsquo;s Complete Alyx stories are mostly uninteresting and have not aged well. But it seems as though they were at the time and had an influence on writers that came later like Mary Gentle (who&amp;rsquo;s work I love).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to read the rest of the stories in this book but I will do so, eventually and report back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
