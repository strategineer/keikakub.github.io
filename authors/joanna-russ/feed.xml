Russ is a poet and it shows. Russ hits the reader with evocative words and images that still hold up today (mostly). The Complete Alyx Stories haven&amp;rsquo;t, but they were influential to writers that came later, like Mary Gentle (as seen in the foreword to her White Crow collection)&amp;hellip; So I&amp;rsquo;m glad Russ wrote them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
