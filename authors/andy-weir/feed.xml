Through journal entries, he tells the story of how he tries to survive.
The story starts out a bit dry but it starts to shine once people on Earth realize he&amp;rsquo;s alive and begin to make plans to rescue him. The POV shifts around between the &amp;ldquo;Martian&amp;rdquo;, the NASA employees trying to save him and the members of the crew that left him behind.</description></item></channel></rss>
