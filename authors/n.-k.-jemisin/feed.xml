K. Jemisin&amp;rsquo;s Broken Earth trilogy, this is another fantasy
setting fully divorced from Tolkien. For that reason alone, I&amp;rsquo;m into it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It features a protagonist who gets entangled with the enslaved gods who are used
and abused by the people in power. Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Obelisk Gate</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-24/</guid><description>&lt;p>This novel suffers from middle book syndrome. It continues the story set up in
the first book and, hopefully, sets up the third and final book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fifth Season</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-29/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The shake that passes will echo. The wave that recedes will come back. The
mountain that rumbles will roar.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fifth Season is a story about suffering and trying to find moments of
pleasure and peace in a broken world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The POV characters are all persecuted and forced to suffer because of
circumstances outside of their control.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
