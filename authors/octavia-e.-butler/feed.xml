The remnants of humanity, after a nuclear apocalypse occurs, are &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo; by aliens and forced to choose between mating with their saviors or never being able to have children again. The rest of the novels didn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as hard but they were interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parable of the Sower</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-02/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
