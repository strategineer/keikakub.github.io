The remnants of humanity, after a nuclear apocalypse occurs, are &amp;ldquo;saved&amp;rdquo; by aliens and forced to choose between mating with their saviors or never being able to have children again. The rest of the novels didn&amp;rsquo;t hit me as hard but they were interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parable Of The Sower</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781538732182/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781538732182/</guid><description>&lt;p>A post-apocalyptic story following a messiah-like figure who wishes to both: survive the horrific world she lives in with ripped from the 90s headlines / Mad Max roving gangs of murderers and rapists while also founding her own religion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uhhhhh very interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that Octavia E. Butler wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to finish the series. Her work is always interesting if a little uneven.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
