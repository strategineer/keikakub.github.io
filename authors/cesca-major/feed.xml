It was fantastically written. The time loop conceit combined with the story being told interspersed with the love letters sent from the husband to his wife (the main character) over the course of their relationship as well as the text messages flooding the her phone was great.
Cesca Major is clearly a master at her craft and I might be willing to read more of her work and work like it.</description></item></channel></rss>
