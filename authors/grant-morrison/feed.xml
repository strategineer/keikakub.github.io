&lt;p>Robotman is a fully mechanical body with a human brain controlling it. He can&amp;rsquo;t feel anything. What makes a human a human if not for their ability to sense the world around them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crazy Jane is a woman with 64 different personalities, so far at least, each possessing a different power. She&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable but it seems like her powers will come in handy time and time again. Who exactly is Crazy Jane? Who are they and what makes they her?&lt;/p>
