always on the lookout for anything I can do to help myself feel less pain.
Underneath all the quackery contained in this book there seems to be a grain of
truth (for me, at least). It helped helped me reduce my chronic pain symptoms
considerably in just a short amount of time. If you (or someone you know)
suffers from chronic pain, I would highly recommend this book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
