I was blown away by her YA novel Iron Window a few months ago so when I saw her next novel Zachary Ying and the Dragon Emperor on sale, I snatched it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, Xiran has interwoven ancient Chinese history and mythology seamlessly with an anime inspired aesthetic (Yugioh in this case whereas Iron Window was very Darling in the Franxx) serving it all through a genre appropriate lens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Iron Widow</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735269934/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780735269934/</guid><description>&lt;p>Big robots,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>fighting off aliens,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>piloted by pairs of young men and women (mostly boys and girls), with the men draining the life force from the women (often killing them in the process).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wu Zetian, eventually becoming the Iron Widow, is sold to the army by her family to become a concubine-pilot. She has a plan to avenge her sister, burn the system to the ground and build it back up again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dayummmmmm this was good.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
