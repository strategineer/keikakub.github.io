Bishop&amp;rsquo;s The Etched City was &lt;em>sublime&lt;/em>. Novels like this don&amp;rsquo;t get written often and reading them leaves me a changed man. The poetry, the philosophy, the mythic and dream-like nature of the writing have left me completely stunned and in awe of its beauty and depth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
