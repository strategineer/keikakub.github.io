I enjoyed it but it was missing a bit of polish.
I enjoyed the cast of characters being mostly of Canadian Indigenous ancestry (well, except the villain). It&amp;rsquo;s not something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen before (which either speaks to my uncultured-ness or the lack of minority voices in the media I&amp;rsquo;m exposed to&amp;hellip; or both).
The story was simple (maybe too simple) but executed well. But it&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a story for a younger demographic though &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s got a few extremely explicit descriptions of sex in it (I&amp;rsquo;ve read some erotica in my day but this was something else).</description></item></channel></rss>
