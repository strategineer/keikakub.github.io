At least you can see this in the first few pages unlike in Emma Newman&amp;rsquo;s previous novel in her Planetfall series, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a mystery detective novel but wants to be one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to its predecessor, After Atlas is way more polished and mostly focuses on developing the interesting parts of the universe but surprisingly retains a super rushed ending that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly come out of nowhere but it feels like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planetfall</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223851/</guid><description>&lt;p>Constant &amp;ldquo;mystery cucking&amp;rdquo; for 95% of the novel, a super rushed ending and paper-thin antagonists heavily detract from the interesting POV and the &amp;ldquo;promised land&amp;rdquo; religious/scientific colonial premise and setting, which is sadly a little underdeveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meh.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
