If you&amp;rsquo;re into chaotic, goofy, absurdist, comically dystopian settings and cooperative/competitive roleplaying systems then you&amp;rsquo;ll love Paranoia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heart</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781913032111/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781913032111/</guid><description>&lt;p>Heart: The City Beneath is a tabletop game about delving into a nightmare undercity that will give you everything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed of â€“ or kill you in the process. It is a dungeon-crawling, story-forward tabletop RPG that focuses on what characters have to lose in pursuit of their dreams in the chaotic darkness beneath the world. Weird but in a good way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
