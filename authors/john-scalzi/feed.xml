I prefer when he doubles down on the absurd and comic modes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This series is not that, although it does have its funny moments, but it&amp;rsquo;s an enjoyable romp.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Collapsing Empire</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-06/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-06/</guid><description>&lt;p>Felt more like a soap opera than a space opera at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people thinking about, talking about and having sex. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of scheming and plotting that sometimes makes sense but often doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I rolled with it, strapped on my suspension of disbelief pants and enjoyed the ride.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
