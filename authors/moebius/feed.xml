&lt;p>Jodorowsky&amp;rsquo;s Dune which is a documentary about Joderowsky&amp;rsquo;s famous attempt at making a filmic adaptation of Frank Herbert&amp;rsquo;s Dune. After watching that I knew that Jodorowsky was definitely someone to keep an eye on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems as though The Incal is where a lot of his creative energy went after his Dune adaption failed to materialize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawn by French artist Moebius and written by Jodorowsky himself, every page of the Incal is an opportunity for the pair to blow you away with the prettiest art you&amp;rsquo;ll ever see and a humongous story told at a pace that&amp;rsquo;s unbelievably fast and exciting.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
