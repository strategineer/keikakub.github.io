Absolutely brutal read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tomie: Complete Deluxe Edition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421590561/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421590561/</guid><description>&lt;p>Juniji Ito&amp;rsquo;s drawing ability vastly surpasses his writing ability. Reading through Tomie has made that abundantly clear to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remina</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974717477/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781974717477/</guid><description>&lt;p>Junji Ito is cool. Uzumaki is great. A lot of his other work is just OK. I think Remina is also just OK.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uzumaki</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421561325/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781421561325/</guid><description>&lt;p>Junji Ito&amp;rsquo;s best work. Suffers a bit from the serialized format that most manga is created in (not all chapters are created equally). It&amp;rsquo;s great overall though.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
