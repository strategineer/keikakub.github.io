&lt;p>This is a decent novel but not one of my favorites from Iain Banks. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick the landing IMO.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Player Of Games</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231465/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231465/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ultimate gamer Gurgeh is tired of his life in a post-scarcity society because he&amp;rsquo;s played every game there is and nothing and no one can put up a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another Iain Banks banger. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in getting into his Culture series, this is probably the best place to start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consider Phlebas</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231380/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781857231380/</guid><description>&lt;p>Iain Banks POV:&lt;/p>
