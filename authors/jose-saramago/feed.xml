José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.
José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).</description></item><item><title>Cain</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</guid><description>Atheist fan fiction written about the Old Testament.
Cain, the murderer of Abel, wanders around iconic moments from the Old Testament (Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark, the Tower of Babel, Sodom, Jericho, etc.) and points out how the God of the Old Testament is fucked up and not worth worshipping.
This is kind of a weird one. I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jose Saramago is going to be converting anyone with this text. It&amp;rsquo;s short, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious and a fan of Jose Saramago, go for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
