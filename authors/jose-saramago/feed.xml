with a small &amp;ldquo;d&amp;rdquo;, shows up, does some stuff then falls in love with a bass
player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The End.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weakest of Jose Saramago&amp;rsquo;s work by far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blindness</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-20/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>José Saramago refuses to use quotation marks, question marks and exclamation
marks in his writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that
exist and can be used to make a text more readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them
instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The
&amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does José Saramago do this?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cain</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>Old Testament fan fiction written by the militantly atheist Jose Saramago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Color me intrigued.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All the Names</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-16/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another Jose Saramago banger. In All The Names, we follow the story of Senhor
José as he works in, navigates through, and subverts, the bureaucracy of the
Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every paragraph screams Saramago, if you know you know, if you&amp;rsquo;re into that,
you&amp;rsquo;re into that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
