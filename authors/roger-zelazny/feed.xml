But I saw no doorways in the sand, and try as I might I could not make the puzzle fall fair.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doorways in the Sand tells the story of Fred Cassidy the &amp;ldquo;Eternal Student&amp;rdquo;, a man who&amp;rsquo;s spent 13 years of his life as an undergrad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He does everything he can to avoid getting a degree so he can continue benefiting from his uncle&amp;rsquo;s generous will, predicated on him being in school (once he graduates he&amp;rsquo;ll be cut off).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fred&amp;rsquo;s idyllic existence is disrupted by the theft of a priceless alien artifact, the star-stone. He&amp;rsquo;s a person of interest for reasons outside of his control and so he is pursued by humans and aliens alike who think he can help them find the stone (can he?).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;You are a living example of the absurdity of things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
