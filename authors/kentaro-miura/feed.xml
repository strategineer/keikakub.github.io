His art will absolutely floor you time and time again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story of Berserk has its ups and downs, but overall I was left disappointed by it. The story feels like a vehicle that constantly thrusts Guts and his crew into contact with the Eldritch and Demonic horrors that Miura excels at drawing. That&amp;rsquo;s great but it&amp;rsquo;s usually not much more than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of mysteries and ideas are dropped for effect or as cliffhangers and then completely forgotten as the series goes on. This is the curse of long-running serialized manga and it&amp;rsquo;s something you&amp;rsquo;ll have to deal with if you want to read Berserk.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
