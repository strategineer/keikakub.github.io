&lt;p>Unbeknownst to anyone, Murderbot has hacked its governor module, granting it the ability to refuse any orders given by its corporate overlords.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, Murderbot finds itself protecting humans, prospectors surveying a planet, when things start going wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hijinks ensue.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
