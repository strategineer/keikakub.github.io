Murderbot hacks its own brain (or part of it) and tells us about it on page 1 of the first novella. People with cybernetic enhancements are so commonplace that Murderbot can (with a little help) disguise itself like one of them and no one bats an eye. From the very start, the story is focused on big corporations having a lot of control and the consequences of that on the workers and slaves (like Murderbot) in the system.</description></item><item><title>All Systems Red</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-06/</guid><description>All Systems Red is about a sentient robot-human hybrid, calling themselves Murderbot, a slave to a mega corporation, tasked with protecting the humans it&amp;rsquo;s told to protect.</description></item></channel></rss>
