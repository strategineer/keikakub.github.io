&lt;p>José Saramago mostly rejects the idea that paragraphs are a writing tool that exist and can be used to make a text more readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>José Saramago mostly refuses to name his characters and chooses to refer to them instead by their job, title or some aspect of their appearance (eg. The &amp;ldquo;doctor&amp;rsquo;s wife&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;girl with the dark glasses&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does José Saramago do this?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cain</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547840178/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547840178/</guid><description>&lt;p>Old Testament fan fiction written by the militantly atheist Jose Saramago.&lt;/p>

In All The Names, we follow the story of Senhor José as he works in, navigates through, and subverts, the bureaucracy of the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every paragraph screams Saramago, if you know you know, if you&amp;rsquo;re into that, you&amp;rsquo;re into that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Cave</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156028790/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156028790/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
