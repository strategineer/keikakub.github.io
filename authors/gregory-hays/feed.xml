emperor of Rome in a.d. 161&amp;ndash;and in his Meditations he provides insights,
wisdom, and practical guidance on everything from living in the world to coping
with adversity to interacting with others. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how much of his
advice has aged well but given his position of supreme power and the changing
times (eg. slavery is bad), some of his meditations have not aged so well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
