&lt;p>Mary Gentle&amp;rsquo;s Grunts in a nutshell. Grunts is a satire of the schlocky high fantasy Tolkien ripoffs of the 70s and 80s. It pokes fun at the aesthetic of the American military as portrayed in film and literature. It combines Grand Guignol (think slapstick but extra gory and violent) dark comedy with satire on bad fantasy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ash - A Secret History</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575069015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575069015/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ash - A Secret History is by far the longest novel I&amp;rsquo;ve read. When I saw the thickness of the book, the number of lines on each page and the miniscule size of the font, I was scared that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to read through the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All it took for me to get over that fear was reading the first few pages. Mary Gentle hooked me with her commitment to telling Ash&amp;rsquo;s story in a way that only she could and she refused to let go of me until the very end.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orthe - Chronicles Of Carrick V</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575072879/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 1800 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780575072879/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
