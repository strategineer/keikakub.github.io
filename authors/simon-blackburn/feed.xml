God, truth, goodness, justice. It is for anyone who believes there are big
questions out there, but does not know how to approach them. Think sets out to
explain what they are and why they are important. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you
knew barely anything about philosophy before reading this, you&amp;rsquo;re in for a wild
ride.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
