Also, there&amp;rsquo;s SuperTrump who&amp;rsquo;s using his infinite charisma to put chips in people&amp;rsquo;s brains to get them to comply with anything and everything he wants (yikes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s Bear Head.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dogs Of War</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-05-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>Adrian Tchaikovsky strikes again. Human animal hybrids with developing consciousness. Check. Hive mind consciousnesses. Check. Empathy porn. Check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might enjoy Dogs of War more than Children of Time? It&amp;rsquo;s more efficient and covers many of the same themes with many more interesting characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eyes Of The Void</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-11-05/</guid><description>&lt;p>The best &amp;ldquo;second novel in a trilogy&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while. To no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, Adrian Tchaikovsky is responsible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eyes of the Void clicked for me when I realized that Adrian Tchaikovsky is an avid tabletop roleplayer and this novel comes alive because he&amp;rsquo;s basically role-playing (to perfection) all of his characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s thought about (and nailed) the way each character thinks and speaks based on where they&amp;rsquo;re from, who they are, their culture, etc. He&amp;rsquo;s great at this and you can see this in all of his work but The Final Architecture series feels built for him to flex his ability to write great characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shards Of Earth</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-16/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>A great space opera by the king of writing alien aliens. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic romp where we follow free adventures of a ragtag group of scoundrels doing their best to save the universe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What could have been just &amp;ldquo;another one of those&amp;rdquo; is greatly elevated by the Adrian Tchaikovsky touch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Memory</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-28/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-28/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;They think.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Not thinking like us, though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Well that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Ruin</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-03/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going on an adventure!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you liked the previous novel in this series, Children of Time, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to enjoy this one just as much if not more (I definitely did). If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, I suggest you start with that one (also great) and then read this sequel. Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;ll be missing out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children Of Time</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-05-20/</guid><description>&lt;p>A very human story with Alien aliens, AI/human constructs and time &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Adrian Tchaikovsky story I read and perhaps the best. Once you pick this book up, you won&amp;rsquo;t be putting it back down until it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
