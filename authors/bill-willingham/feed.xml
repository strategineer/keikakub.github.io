&lt;p>This comic book was first published in 2002 by a Pro-Israel author. Fables is explicitly an allegory for the Isreal-Palestenian conflict. So I&amp;rsquo;m expecting more than a little yikes with a dash of Islamophobia in this comic book so let&amp;rsquo;s see how far we get.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
