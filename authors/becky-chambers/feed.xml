&lt;p>It was OK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike The Galaxy and The Ground Within (also written by Becky Chambers), this novella doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of space (see what I did there?) to develop its characters and have you care about them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Galaxy, And The Ground Within</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-21/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-06-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within is a science fiction novel about a diverse cast of characters from all over the galaxy, stuck at an inter-planetary truck stop for an indeterminate span of time, getting to know one another and helping each other overcome (or make peace with) problems in their personal lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the characters learned about each other and gradually opened up about themselves, I started to see parts of myself reflected in them making me feel invested in the mostly low stakes interactions occurring between the characters.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
