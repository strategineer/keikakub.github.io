It&amp;rsquo;s a little wacky.
Notes after reading the whole book:
Not necessary reading if you&amp;rsquo;re pressed for time. It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of short stories set within the world of Earthsea, some are fun, others are interesting but none are essential to appreciating the series as a whole.</description></item><item><title>Tehanu</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-27/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-27/</guid><description>Way better than The Farthest Shore, which might be Ursula&amp;rsquo;s worst work I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far. It&amp;rsquo;s a sequel to both Tehanu and the Farthest Shore but I think you could probably skip The Farthest Shore and be OK with reading the rest of the series.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the series alongside Ranged Touch Shelved by Genre podcast and it&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun!
I have an insatiable desire to read, write, think and talk about the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so a book club-like podcast is a perfect fit for me.</description></item><item><title>The Farthest Shore</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-21/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-21/</guid><description>Hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged as well as the first two books in the series IMO.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a retread of the first book with a little bit of the 80s crack epidemic and reganomics commentary spliced into it. It&amp;rsquo;s not as evergreen as the other books.</description></item><item><title>Words are my Matter</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</guid><description>1/3 essays about life 1/3 book forewords 1/3 book reviews
All written by Ursula K. Le Guin between 2000 and 2016.
Ursula K. Le Guin is great so by the transitive property this text is also great.
As Le Guin writes in the book itself, the forewords and reviews she&amp;rsquo;s written here shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be misconstrued as recommendations per say.
But from reading the text, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to tell the difference between her really liking a book/author vs.</description></item><item><title>Tombs of Atuan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-02/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Wizard of Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Lathe of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</guid><description>spoiler alert</description></item></channel></rss>
