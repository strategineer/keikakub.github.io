&lt;p>An anthropologist-like character lands on a planet with people who exhibit sexually differentiated physical characteristics, male or female depending on the circumstances, for a few days every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Genly Ai&amp;rsquo;s task is to convince them to join the coalition of planets he comes from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Le Guin uses this framework to explore the various ways in which this physical ambisexuality affects their society and, in doing so, explores how sex and gender affect our own.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching: A Book about the Way and the Power of the Way</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-09/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Tales from Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-06/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-04-06/</guid><description>&lt;p>A collection of short stories and novellas set in the Earthsea setting that Ursula wrote to help her find out how to continue the story when prompted to do so by her publisher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s some great stories here but I prefer the Earthsea novels to this generally (don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on The Farthest Shore).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tehanu</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-27/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2024-03-27/</guid><description>&lt;p>A sequel to both The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering how uninteresting The Farthest Shore is, I&amp;rsquo;m confident saying that you can skip that book and go straight to Tehanu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Farthest Shore</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-21/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-10-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged as well as the first two books in the series IMO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a retread of the first book with a little bit of the 80s crack epidemic and reganomics commentary spliced into it. It&amp;rsquo;s not as evergreen as the other books.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Words are my Matter</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-09-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>1/3 essays about life
1/3 book forewords
1/3 book reviews&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All written by Ursula K. Le Guin between 2000 and 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ursula K. Le Guin is great, so to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about this text.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tombs of Atuan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-02/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-08-02/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Wizard of Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-30/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Lathe of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/2023-07-27/</guid><description> Gaslight, Manifest, Philosophize.</description></item></channel></rss>
