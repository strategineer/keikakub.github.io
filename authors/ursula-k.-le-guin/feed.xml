 &lt;p>The Luau served a first-rate venison steak. What would they say on old Earth if they saw one man eating a kilogram of meat at one meal? Poor damn soybeansuckers!&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hoorah US military (but in SPACE) does a colonialism, oppressing and enslaving the sentient beings on a planet to extract the valuable resources from the land, wood. The oppressed people learn about the concept of murder from the Humans and use it to fight back.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lavinia</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156033688/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780156033688/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ursula K. Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s Greco-Roman mythical retelling from 2008, way before these kinds of novels became &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; and everyone started writing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lavinia tells the story of, well, Lavinia, a character in Vergil&amp;rsquo;s Aeneid who isn&amp;rsquo;t given any speaking lines. Lavinia being such a paper thin character gives Le Guin the opportunity to fill in the many gaps. And, to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise, she&amp;rsquo;s done a great job of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481465588/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781481465588/</guid><description>&lt;p>These illustrations are kind of whack. All the characters look like little goblins.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s Earthsea series is fantastic.&lt;/p>

Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s conclusion to her fantastic Earthsea series. Once again, she manages to create a fantasy world where violence doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve everything. Her characters engage in the mundane activities that real people do most of the time: chat, make friends, think about their loved ones, cuddle with their pets, etc. The way she writes these mundane scenes makes them feel just as important and interesting as they really are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Left Hand Of Darkness</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780441478125/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780441478125/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
 
 &lt;p>The king was pregnant.&lt;/p>
 
 &lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>An anthropologist-like character lands on a planet with people who exhibit sexually differentiated physical characteristics, male or female depending on the circumstances, for a few days every month. Hijinks ensues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching - A Book About The Way And The Power Of The Way</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781611807240/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781611807240/</guid><description>&lt;p>The most well put together rendition of the Tao Te Ching I&amp;rsquo;ve read with commentary and thoughts throughout from my lord and savior Ursula K. Le Guin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with this one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tales From Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547722047/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547722047/</guid><description>&lt;p>A collection of short stories and novellas set in the Earthsea setting that Ursula wrote to help her find out how to continue the story when prompted to do so by her publisher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s some great stories here but I prefer the Earthsea novels to this generally (don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on The Farthest Shore).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tehanu</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223592/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781473223592/</guid><description>&lt;p>A sequel to both The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering how uninteresting The Farthest Shore is, I&amp;rsquo;m confident saying that you can skip that book and go straight to Tehanu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Farthest Shore</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459922/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459922/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hasn&amp;rsquo;t aged as well as the first two books in the series IMO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a retread of the first book with a little bit of the 80s crack epidemic and reganomics commentary spliced into it. It&amp;rsquo;s not as evergreen as the other books.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Words Are My Matter - Writings On Life And Books</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780358212102/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780358212102/</guid><description>&lt;p>1/3 essays about life 1/3 book forewords 1/3 book reviews&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All written by Ursula K. Le Guin between 2000 and 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ursula K. Le Guin is great, so to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to love about this text.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Tombs Of Atuan</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459908/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781442459908/</guid><description>&lt;p>Le Guin mostly successful attempt to write a story in the world of a Wizard of Earthsea told from the perspective of a girl and, eventually, woman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ged shows up and steals the show a little bit from Tenar which Le Guin will rectify in the subsequent novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wizard Of Earthsea</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547722023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9780547722023/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a, soon-to-be wizard, on a archipelago world. He goes to wizard school and becomes xXx#1_Mage_NAxXx.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A classic fantasy story elevated by Le Guin&amp;rsquo;s poetic use of words. Struggles to give women in the story the story they deserve, an issue dealt with in the subsequent novels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lathe Of Heaven</title><link>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://strategineer.com/books/9781416556961/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello?
