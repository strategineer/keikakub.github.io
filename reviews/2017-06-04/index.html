It consists of shooting enemies, picking up powerups, avoid/dodging enemies, shooting with your secondary more powerful weapon and doing it over and over again against a wide variety of different enemies and bosses. There&rsquo;s never a dull moment, it&rsquo;s action action and even more action.</li><li>Great with friends. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from the game but I played it with a friend. To be honest, we had a hard time putting the game down, we were having a lot of fun and we were laughing so much.</li><li>The overall tone of the game set primarily by the art, the environments, the story, the voice acting and the soundtrack is hard to explain but it&rsquo;s unique and unlike anything I&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</li><li>The soundtrack is amazing. All the songs are really well put together and fit the game perfectly. When one song in particular called Little Android started playing I was laughing so hard that it forced me to get up and take a piss because I was going to piss in my pants, however while pissing I was laughing even harder and it almost made me shit my pants. Truly a great work of art.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2017-06-25/>◀️Furi</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2017-05-29/>▶️Hook</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><h4>Recent reviews</h4></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-03-13/><li class=footer-shortlist-item>Trials Rising
