      <description>Trials Rising, and the Trials series as a whole, fully embraces the &amp;quot;Easy to Learn, Hard to Master&amp;quot; motto as a core game design pillar and provides an experience that is easier to get into for new players while providing the challenging gameplay that the series is known for.
In Trials, players are tasked with riding a motorcycle from point A to point B on a 2D track as fast as possible without crashing.</description>

      <description>WARNING: I&amp;rsquo;ve given a negative review of Spintires even though I find the game to be truly unique and interesting based on the fact that the publisher of the game is not paying the developer for his work and because the sequel to the game Spintires: Mudrunner (with a different publisher who&amp;rsquo;s paying the developer) is a more polished and complete experience.
In Spintires you play a driver tasked with bringing lumber from point A to point B in various muddy, forested, swampy and sometimes watery Eastern European wilderness locations by making use of different heavy duty vehicles.</description>

      <title>ATOM RPG</title>

      <description>WARNING: This a rant more than it is a comprehensive review. I did not enjoy my time with ATOM RPG even though I&amp;rsquo;m a big old school Fallout fan but I seem to be in the minority so take my words with a grain of salt (a bucket of salt perhaps).
ATOM RPG is Fallout 1/2 if it was set in Russia in an uninspired world filled with hundreds of characters who barely have anything interesting to say with little to no environmental storytelling, it strongly encourages you to play certain character builds and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually allow you to make meaningful choices (small or big) defeating the purpose of playing a CRPG in the first place.</description>

      <title>F3AR</title>
      <link>https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-06/</link>

      <guid>https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-06/</guid>
      <description>F3AR is a horror themed FPS that I played as a cooperative experience with a friend. Its core gameplay of shooting bad dudes is quite dated, combining that with its hard to follow and impossible to care about storyline told through very video gamey cinematics results in an experience that leaves much to be desired.
One of its only redeeming factors are the asymmetric characters that you play as in coop: one is a classic FPS protagonist that can slow down time and the other is a classic evil dude who can force choke people and take control of their bodies temporarily.</description>

      <guid>https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-05/</guid>
      <description>Paratopic is a spooky PS1/lofi horror experience. Its use of lofi weird graphics, its soundtrack and the story all work in unison to make you feel extremely uncomfortable and unsettled whilst playing the game. I enjoy concise and short experiences however Paratopic feels shorter than it deserves to be and thus left me wanting more.</description>

      <description>Zero Escape: The Nonary Games is a bundle of remastered PC versions of the first (999) and second (Virtue&amp;rsquo;s Last Reward) games in the Zero Escape series. If you enjoy 999, then you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy Virtue&amp;rsquo;s Last Reward because it is very good sequel that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor thus I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing my review on 999 for the most part to avoid spoiling anything for Virtue&amp;rsquo;s Last Reward.</description>
