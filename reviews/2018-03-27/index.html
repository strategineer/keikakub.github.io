If you&rsquo;re a big fan of CRPGs and the post apocalyptic setting then I&rsquo;d suggest you try it out but don&rsquo;t expect to come away from the experience fully satisfied.</div></div></div><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-xl-6 readable-footer"><nav class=footer><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=col-12><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-next"><div class="next-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2018-07-15/>◀️The Evil Within 2</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-paginator-previous"><div class="previous-article-link col-12 mx-auto"><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2018-03-26/>▶️Warhammer Vermintide 2</a></div></div><div class="d-flex justify-content-center footer-shortlist-title"><span class=h4>Recent reviews</span></div><div class=footer-shortlist-parent><ul class=footer-shortlist-list><li class=footer-shortlist-item><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-03-13/>Trials Rising
