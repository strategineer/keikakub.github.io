In Spintires you play a driver tasked with bringing lumber from point A to point B in various muddy, forested, swampy and sometimes watery Eastern European wilderness locations by making use of different heavy duty vehicles.</div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-27/><nobr><h2>More →</h3></nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-26/>ATOM RPG

I did not enjoy my time with ATOM RPG even though I&rsquo;m a big old school Fallout fan but I seem to be in the minority so take my words with a grain of salt (a bucket of salt perhaps).
ATOM RPG is Fallout 1/2 if it was set in Russia in an uninspired world filled with hundreds of characters who barely have anything interesting to say with little to no environmental storytelling, it strongly encourages you to play certain character builds and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to actually allow you to make meaningful choices (small or big) defeating the purpose of playing a CRPG in the first place.</div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-26/><nobr><h2>More →</h3></nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-06/>F3AR

Its core gameplay of shooting bad dudes is quite dated, combining that with its hard to follow and impossible to care about storyline told through very video gamey cinematics results in an experience that leaves much to be desired.
One of its only redeeming factors are the asymmetric characters that you play as in coop: one is a classic FPS protagonist that can slow down time and the other is a classic evil dude who can force choke people and take control of their bodies temporarily.</div><div class="row read-more"><div class=col><a class=float-right href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2019-02-06/><nobr><h2>More →</h3></nobr></a></div></div></article><article class=post-summary><div class="row summary-row"><div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center"><h2 class=summary-title><a href=https://strategineer.com/reviews/2018-03-27/>Wasteland 2
